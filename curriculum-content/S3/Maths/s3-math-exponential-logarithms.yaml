    - problemText: Determine whether the function $f(x) = 5^x$ is classified as an exponential function. Explain your reasoning
        based on the position of the variable.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start by reviewing the fundamental definition of an exponential function. Remember where
        the variable must be located!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, $f(x) = 5^x$ is an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of an exponential function: $f(x) = a^x$, where $a$ is a constant base and $x$ is the variable
        exponent.'
      - In the function $f(x) = 5^x$, the base is the constant 5, and the variable $x$ is in the exponent.
      - Since the variable is in the exponent, this function matches the definition of an exponential function.

    - problemText: Is the function $g(x) = x^4$ an exponential function? Justify your answer.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, $g(x) = x^4$ is not an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the structure of the function $g(x) = x^4$.
      - In this function, the variable $x$ is the base, and the exponent (4) is a constant number.
      - Functions where the variable is the base and the exponent is a constant are defined as polynomial functions, not exponential
        functions.

    - problemText: Consider the function $h(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$. Is this an exponential function, even though it is multiplied
        by a coefficient?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, $h(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$ is an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the core structure of the function $h(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$.
      - The defining characteristic of an exponential function is the presence of the variable $x$ in the exponent, acting
        on a constant base (3).
      - Although the function is vertically stretched by the coefficient 2, the variable remains in the exponent, confirming
        that the function is exponential.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Explain why $k(x) = 3x^2 + 5$ cannot be classified as an exponential function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $k(x) = 3x^2 + 5$ is not an exponential function because the variable $x$ is the base, not the exponent.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Compare the structure of $k(x) = 3x^2 + 5$ with the general form of an exponential function $f(x) = a^x$.
      - In $k(x)$, the variable $x$ is the base, and it is raised to a constant power (2). The function also includes other
        polynomial terms and a constant shift.
      - Since the variable is not located in the exponent, $k(x)$ is a polynomial function (specifically, a quadratic function),
        not an exponential function.

    - problemText: Classify the function $m(x) = 0.8^x + 1$. Is it exponential or non-exponential?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It is an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Examine the primary term of the function, $0.8^x$.
      - The base (0.8) is a constant, and the variable ($x$) is in the exponent.
      - The addition of the constant (+1) represents a vertical shift but does not change the fundamental category of the
        function. Because the variable is in the exponent, $m(x)$ is exponential.

    - problemText: Consider the function $f(x) = 3 \cdot 5^x + 10$. Is this function classified as exponential or non-exponential?
        Provide a detailed explanation focusing on the position of the variable $x$.
      avatarIntro: Identifying functions is key to understanding their behavior. Remember to look closely at where the variable
        is located in relation to the operations.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of an exponential function: the variable must appear in the exponent of a constant base.'
      - In the function $f(x) = 3 \cdot 5^x + 10$, the variable $x$ is the exponent attached to the base 5.
      - The multiplication by 3 (coefficient) and the addition of 10 (vertical shift) do not change the fundamental structure
        where the variable is the exponent.
      - Therefore, $f(x)$ is an exponential function.

    - problemText: Classify the function $g(x) = 2x - 7^3$. Is it exponential or non-exponential? Explain why the term $7^3$
        does not make the function exponential.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Non-Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the terms in the function $g(x) = 2x - 7^3$.
      - The first term, $2x$, is a linear term where the variable $x$ is the base (raised implicitly to the power 1).
      - The second term, $7^3$, is a constant value (since 7 and 3 are both fixed numbers; $7^3 = 343$).
      - Since the variable $x$ is not in the exponent of a constant base anywhere in the expression, the function is non-exponential
        (specifically, it is a linear polynomial). The constant exponential term $7^3$ is irrelevant to the function's classification
        regarding $x$.

    - problemText: Determine whether $h(x) = 0.5^x$ is an exponential function. Justify your answer based on the role of the
        variable.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Examine the structure of $h(x) = 0.5^x$.
      - The base is the constant $0.5$.
      - The variable $x$ occupies the position of the exponent.
      - By definition, any function where a constant base is raised to a power containing the variable is an exponential function.
        Since $x$ is the exponent, $h(x)$ is exponential.

      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: Consider the function $k(x) = 5x^2 + 3^4$. Classify this function as exponential or non-exponential, and
        explain your choice by identifying the base and exponent for the variable term.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Non-Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify where the variable $x$ appears in $k(x) = 5x^2 + 3^4$.
      - The variable appears in the term $5x^2$. Here, $x$ is the base, and the exponent is the constant number 2.
      - The term $3^4$ is a constant value (81) and does not contain the variable $x$.
      - Since the variable $x$ is the base and not in the exponent, the function is a polynomial (quadratic) and is therefore
        non-exponential.
      id: q3-4
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: Is the function $m(x) = x^3$ an exponential function? Explain why or why not, contrasting its structure
        with the required form of an exponential equation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Non-Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The function $m(x) = x^3$ is a polynomial function (specifically, a cubic function).
      - In this function, the variable $x$ is the base, and the exponent is the constant number 3.
      - For a function to be exponential, the base must be a constant number greater than zero and not equal to one, and the
        exponent must contain the variable.
      - Since the variable is the base, $m(x)$ is non-exponential.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the y-intercept by locating the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. For $f(x) = b^x$, this is always
        (0, 1).
      - Determine the domain by observing the possible x-values the graph covers. Since the graph extends indefinitely horizontally
        in both directions, the domain is all real numbers.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The horizontal asymptote is the line that the graph approaches but never touches as $x$ approaches negative infinity.
        For $f(x) = b^x$, this line is $y=0$.
      - The range consists of all possible y-values. Since the graph lies entirely above the horizontal asymptote $y=0$, the
        range is all positive real numbers, $y > 0$.

      finalAnswer: As $x \to \infty$, $f(x) \to 0$. As $x \to -\infty$, $f(x) \to \infty$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the graph as $x$ moves far to the right ($x \to \infty$). The graph approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=0$,
        so $f(x) \to 0$.
      - Analyze the graph as $x$ moves far to the left ($x \to -\infty$). The graph increases without bound, so $f(x) \to

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The y-intercept is where $x=0$, which is (0, 1).
      - The horizontal asymptote is the line $y=0$.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The range is the set of all output values (y-values). Since the function is always positive, the range is $y > 0$.
      - The domain is the set of all input values (x-values). Since the graph extends infinitely left and right, the domain
        is all real numbers.

          function2Label: g(x)
          showLegend: true
      finalAnswer: $g(x)=10^x$ exhibits a much steeper growth rate. This is because $g(x)$ has a significantly larger base
        (10 > 3). The base determines the multiplication factor for each unit increase in $x$; thus, multiplying by 10 causes
        the output to increase much faster than multiplying by 3.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Observe the graph: $g(x)=10^x$ is visually steeper than $f(x)=3^x$ for $x>0$.'
      - 'Identify the bases: The base of $f(x)$ is 3 and the base of $g(x)$ is 10.'

          showLegend: true
      finalAnswer: $f(x)=0.5^x$ decays faster. For exponential decay functions ($0 < b < 1$), the function with the base closer
        to 0 (and farther from 1) decays more rapidly. Since $0.5$ is closer to 0 than $0.8$, $f(x)$ loses value more quickly.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Observe the graph: $f(x)=0.5^x$ drops below $g(x)=0.8^x$ more quickly as $x$ increases, indicating faster decay.'
      - 'Identify the bases: Bases are 0.5 and 0.8. Both are decay bases ($0 < b < 1$).'
      - 'Determine the rate: Decay is faster when the base is smaller (closer to 0). Since $0.5 < 0.8$, $f(x)$ decays faster

      finalAnswer: $f(x)=2^x$ is exponential growth, and $g(x)=0.5^x$ is exponential decay. This difference is determined
        by the base relative to the number 1. $f(x)$ grows because its base (2) is greater than 1, meaning the quantity increases
        over time. $g(x)$ decays because its base (0.5) is between 0 and 1, meaning the quantity decreases over time.

      finalAnswer: $g(x)=3^x$ is steeper. Since $3 > 2$, $g(x)$ has a larger base. The base represents the multiplication
        factor applied for every unit increase in $x$. Since multiplying by 3 causes a faster rate of increase than multiplying

        corresponds to the function that approaches the horizontal asymptote ($y=0$) faster? Explain why this function decays
        faster.

          showLegend: true
      finalAnswer: The base $0.3$ corresponds to $f(x)$, which approaches the asymptote faster (decays faster). For decay
        functions, the base represents the percentage of the value remaining after each time period (30% remaining vs 70%
        remaining). Since 0.3 is farther from 1, the function decreases more aggressively toward zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Observe the decay curves: $f(x)=0.3^x$ drops faster and stays closer to the x-axis for $x>0$.'
      - 'Identify the bases: Bases are 0.3 and 0.7.'
      - 'Explain the decay speed: Decay is faster when the retention factor (base) is smaller. A base of 0.3 means the function
        is only 30% of its previous value, resulting in a 70% decrease per step. A base of 0.7 results in only a 30% decrease
        per step. Therefore, $f(x)$ decays faster.'

    - problemText: The concentration of a specific drug in a patient's bloodstream decreases by 10% every hour through metabolism.
        Identify the decay factor ($a$) for this process and explain why the factor confirms this relationship is one of exponential
        decay.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! We are exploring exponential decay, where quantities decrease by a constant percentage over time.
        Let's analyze this drug metabolism scenario.
      mathTool:
        toolName: exponentialGraph
        parameters:
          base: 0.9
          coefficient: 1
          showGrid: true
          realWorldContext: true
          showAsymptote: true
      finalAnswer: The decay factor is 0.90. This confirms exponential decay because the factor $a$ is less than 1 but greater
        than 0 ($0 < 0.90 < 1$), meaning the initial quantity is multiplied by a fraction in each time period, causing it
        to decrease steadily towards zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the rate of decrease ($r$). Here, $r = 10\%$, or 0.10.
      - Calculate the decay factor ($a$) using the formula $a = 1 - r$. $a = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.
      - 'State the condition for exponential decay: $0 < a < 1$. Since $0 < 0.90 < 1$, the process is exponential decay.'
      - Explain that a factor between 0 and 1 ensures the quantity decreases but never reaches zero (as illustrated by the
        graph approaching the asymptote $y=0$).

          showGrid: true
          realWorldContext: true
          showAsymptote: true
      finalAnswer: The decay factor $a$ is 0.75. The condition for exponential decay is $0 < a < 1$. Since $0 < 0.75 < 1$,
        this confirms the machinery's value follows an exponential decay model.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the percentage decrease, $r = 25\% = 0.25$.
      - 'Use the alternative form $a = 1 - r$ to find the decay factor: $a = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.'
      - Verify the decay condition. Exponential decay occurs when the base $a$ satisfies $0 < a < 1$.
      - Since $0.75$ falls within this range, the rate represents decay.

      finalAnswer: The decay factor $a$ is 0.70. The condition $0 < a < 1$ signifies that the quantity (current) is multiplied
        by a value less than 1 in each period, causing it to decrease consistently. Since $a > 0$, the quantity remains positive
        and never instantaneously reaches zero (approaching the asymptote $y=0$).

        Convert this expression into its equivalent logarithmic form.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Logarithms are simply a different way to ask about exponents. Let's practice converting between
        these two forms to solidify your understanding.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: \log 100 = 2
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the fundamental definition of the common logarithm: If $10^x = y$, then $\log y = x$. The logarithm asks,
        ''What power (x) must 10 be raised to in order to equal y?'''
      - In the given equation, $10^2 = 100$, the power $x$ is 2, and the result $y$ is 100.
      - 'Substitute these values into the logarithmic form: $\log 100 = 2$. This means the power of 10 that gives 100 is 2.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 10^{-3} = 0.001
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The logarithmic form $\log y = x$ is equivalent to the exponential form $10^x = y$.
      - In $\log 0.001 = -3$, the base is 10, the logarithm result (the exponent, $x$) is -3, and the input value ($y$) is
        0.001.
      - Substituting these parts into the exponential form yields $10^{-3} = 0.001$. This confirms that a negative exponent
        results in a value between 0 and 1.

      finalAnswer: \log 10000 = 4
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The equation $10^4 = 10000$ identifies the power (4) that the base (10) is raised to.
      - The logarithmic form, $\log y = x$, is designed to isolate and define this exponent $x$.
      - Using the values, the equivalent logarithmic statement is $\log 10000 = 4$.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the conversion rule: $\log y = x$ means $10^x = y$.'
      - In the given statement, the base is 10, the exponent ($x$) is 0, and the result ($y$) is 1.
      - Substituting these components into the exponential form gives $10^0 = 1$. This confirms the general rule that any
        non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one.

        How does the logarithmic form reflect the definition of a negative exponent?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: \log 0.1 = -1
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The exponential form $10^{-1} = 0.1$ states that the power -1 applied to base 10 results in 0.1.
      - 'The logarithmic function finds this power (exponent). We use the conversion: If $10^x = y$, then $\log y = x$.'
      - Substituting the values yields $\log 0.1 = -1$. The negative result (-1) in the logarithm indicates that the original
        number (0.1) was obtained by taking the reciprocal of the base raised to a positive power ($1/10^1$).

      - 'If we attempt to evaluate $\log(0)$, we are asking: ''What exponent, $y$, must 10 be raised to in order to equal

          realWorldContext: true
      finalAnswer: Log(-10) is undefined.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The expression $\log(-10)$ requires us to find an exponent $y$ such that $10^y = -10$.
      - If 10 is raised to a positive power (e.g., $10^2 = 100$), the result is positive.
      - If 10 is raised to a negative power (e.g., $10^{-2} = 0.01$), the result is positive.
      - If 10 is raised to the power of zero ($10^0 = 1$), the result is positive.
      - Since 10 raised to any real power is always positive, it can never equal a negative number like -10. Thus, negative
        numbers are not allowed in the domain of the logarithm.

      finalAnswer: 'Domain: $x > 0$.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The domain of a function consists of all permissible input values, $x$.
      - For the logarithm function $f(x) = \log x$, the argument $x$ must be strictly greater than zero ($x > 0$).
      - This is because the inverse exponential function, $10^y = x$, only produces positive results for $x$.

      finalAnswer: 'Range: All real numbers, or $(-\infty, \infty)$.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The range of a function refers to all possible output values, $y$.
      - The logarithmic function $y = \log x$ is the inverse of the exponential function $x = 10^y$.
      - Since the base (10) is positive, we can raise it to any real number $y$. If $y$ is a very large positive number, $x$
        is very large. If $y$ is a very large negative number, $x$ is very close to zero.
      - Because the inputs of the exponential function ($y$) cover all real numbers, the outputs (range) of the inverse logarithmic
        function must also cover all real numbers.
      - Graphically, the curve extends infinitely high and infinitely low, covering all possible y-values.

          realWorldContext: true
      finalAnswer: The vertical asymptote is located at $x = 0$ (the y-axis).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - A vertical asymptote exists where the function approaches positive or negative infinity.
      - For $f(x) = \log x$, as $x$ approaches 0 from the right side (e.g., $x=0.0001$), the value of the function decreases
        rapidly towards $-\infty$.
      - Therefore, the line $x = 0$ (the y-axis) is the vertical asymptote.
      - The vertical asymptote $x=0$ marks the boundary of the domain. Since the function is only defined for $x > 0$, the
        graph cannot exist on or to the left of this vertical line.

      avatarIntro: Solving exponential equations can be tricky when the bases don't match. Let's explore how logarithms unlock
        these variables.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Logarithms must be used because 19 cannot be written as a simple integer power of 3 ($3^2=9$ and $3^3=27$).
        Since the variable $x$ is in the exponent, the only way to isolate it algebraically is by applying the Power Law of

        like this, and what characteristic of the numbers (0.5 and 0.15) prevents its use here.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The same-base method fails when the two sides of the equation ($0.5$ and $0.15$) cannot be easily expressed
        as powers of a common base, particularly when the resulting exponent would be non-integer. For $0.5^t = 0.15$, $0.15$
        is not a recognizable integer or simple rational power of $0.5$. If we tried to write $0.15 = 0.5^k$, $k$ would be

    - problemText: In a specialized acoustics scale using base $b=9$, calculate the value of $\log_9(1)$. Explain the fundamental
        reason why the logarithm of 1 is always zero, regardless of the base chosen (provided the base is valid).
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Understanding the universal properties of logarithms is key to mastering this topic. Let's start
        by looking at what happens when the argument is one.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '0'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Recall the definition of the logarithm: $\log_a(x) = y$ means $a^y = x$.'
      - 'Step 2: Apply this definition to the given problem: $\log_9(1) = y$ means $9^y = 1$.'
      - 'Step 3: Since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1, we must have $y=0$. Thus, $\log_9(1) = 0$.'
      - 'Step 4: This property ($\log_a(1) = 0$) is universal because $a^0 = 1$ is true for any valid logarithm base $a$.'

    - problemText: A storage system uses a highly optimized addressing scheme based on base 11. Determine the exact value
        of $\log_{11}(11)$. Explain the corresponding exponential relationship that defines this universal property.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '1'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the base ($a=11$) and the argument ($x=11$). The problem is to evaluate $\log_{11}(11)$.'
      - 'Step 2: Recall the universal property that states $\log_a(a) = 1$. This is because $a^1 = a$.'
      - 'Step 3: Applying this property, $\log_{11}(11) = 1$.'
      - 'Step 4: The corresponding exponential relationship is $11^1 = 11$, showing that the exponent needed to get the base
        itself is always 1.'

    - problemText: An equation relating geological rock stress factors involves the expression $\log_5(125)$. Evaluate this
        expression by recognizing that 125 is a power of the base 5, utilizing the identity $\log_a(a^n) = n$.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '3'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the base ($a=5$) and express the argument (125) as a power of the base.'
      - 'Step 2: $125 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^3$.'
      - 'Step 3: Substitute this back into the logarithmic expression: $\log_5(125) = \log_5(5^3)$.'
      - 'Step 4: Apply the identity $\log_a(a^n) = n$. Therefore, $\log_5(5^3) = 3$.'

    - problemText: An environmental scientist models the ratio of initial pollution ($P_I$) to current pollution ($P_C$) using
        the expression $\log_4(64 P_I) - \log_4(P_I)$. Simplify this expression completely using the Quotient Law of Logarithms.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '3'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Apply the Quotient Law of Logarithms: $\log_a(M) - \log_a(N) = \log_a(M/N)$.'
      - 'Step 2: Simplify the expression: $\log_4(64 P_I) - \log_4(P_I) = \log_4 \left( \frac{64 P_I}{P_I} \right)$.'
      - 'Step 3: Cancel the variable $P_I$: $\log_4(64)$.'
      - 'Step 4: Evaluate $\log_4(64)$ by expressing 64 as a power of 4: $64 = 4^3$. Thus, $\log_4(4^3) = 3$.'

    - problemText: In telecommunications, two amplifiers increase a signal by factors $F_1 = 16$ and $F_2 = 4$. If the combined
        gain is calculated using base 2 logarithms as $\log_2(16) + \log_2(4)$, evaluate this expression using the Product
        Law of Logarithms first, and then simplify the result.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '6'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Apply the Product Law of Logarithms: $\log_a(M) + \log_a(N) = \log_a(M \times N)$.'
      - 'Step 2: Combine the terms: $\log_2(16) + \log_2(4) = \log_2(16 \times 4)$.'
      - 'Step 3: Calculate the product: $\log_2(64)$.'
      - 'Step 4: Evaluate $\log_2(64)$ by finding the exponent $n$ such that $2^n = 64$. Since $2^6 = 64$, the result is 6.'

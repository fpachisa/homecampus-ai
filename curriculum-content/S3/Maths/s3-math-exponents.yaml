      - Count the number of places the original decimal point moved to reach the new position.
      - The decimal moved 7 places to the right.
      - Since the original number (0.000000782) is less than 1, the exponent must be negative. $k = -7$.

        imes 10^9$ years, what essential information does the $10^9$ component convey about the original number?"
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It represents the place value of the first significant digit (the 6), which is the billions place.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall that standard form is written as $a \times 10^k$, where $a$ is the first significant figure followed by a decimal.
      - The exponent $k$ determines the magnitude of the number.
      - Specifically, $10^k$ represents the place value of the first significant digit.
      - Since $k=9$, $10^9$ corresponds to the billions place.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '4'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the starting position of the decimal point (at the end of 45,000).
      - Identify the required position of the decimal point for standard form (after the first significant digit, 4).
      - 'Count the number of places the decimal must move: 45,000 $\to$ 4.5000. This is 4 places to the left.'
      - Since the original number is greater than 10, the exponent $k$ is positive, so $k=4$.

    - problemText: A measurement is recorded in standard form $a \times 10^k$. If the exponent $k$ is equal to $-3$, what
        does this immediately tell you about the magnitude of the original measurement compared to 1?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The original number is less than 1.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the sign of the exponent $k$. Here, $k = -3$, which is negative.
      - A negative exponent indicates that the decimal point must be moved to the left to obtain the standard form, meaning
        the original number was a small fraction.
      - Therefore, if $k < 0$, the original number must be less than 1.

      finalAnswer: The digit 4 is in the hundred thousands place, which is equivalent to $10^5$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Locate the first significant digit, 4.
      - Determine the place value of the digit 4 in 450,000; it is 400,000.
      - 'Write 400,000 as a power of 10: $400,000 = 4 \times 100,000 = 4 \times 10^5$.'
      - Since the place value of the first digit is $10^5$, the exponent $k$ in standard form ($4.5 \times 10^k$) must be
        5.

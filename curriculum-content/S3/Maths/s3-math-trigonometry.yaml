      avatarIntro: It's time to test your memory of the special angle values. Remember these values are crucial for higher
        levels of trigonometry!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the exact value relationship for the sine function at $60^\circ$.
      - Based on the 30-60-90 triangle ratios, $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}$.
      - The exact value is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

    - problemText: Simplify the expression $\cos(30^\circ) + \tan(45^\circ)$ and express the result as a single fraction.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the exact values: $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$.'
      - 'Substitute these values into the expression: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1$.'
      - To express this as a single fraction, rewrite 1 as $\frac{2}{2}$.
      - 'Combine the terms: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = \frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}$.'

    - problemText: Explain why $\sin(0^\circ)$ and $\cos(90^\circ)$ must be equal, and state the common exact value they share.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: They are equal because $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$ are complementary angles (they sum to $90^\circ$), and
        sine of an angle equals cosine of its complement. The common exact value is 0.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the relationship between the angles $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$. They are complementary since $0 + 90 = 90$.
      - 'Recall the complementary angle identity: $\sin(\theta) = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)$.'
      - Therefore, $\sin(0^\circ) = \cos(90^\circ - 0^\circ) = \cos(90^\circ)$.
      - 'State the exact value: $\sin(0^\circ) = 0$ and $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$. The common value is 0.'

    - problemText: 'Determine which trigonometric value is larger: $\tan(30^\circ)$ or $\cos(60^\circ)$?'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\tan(30^\circ)$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Find the exact value for $\tan(30^\circ)$: $\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$.'
      - 'Find the exact value for $\cos(60^\circ)$: $\cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$.'
      - To compare $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, use a common denominator (6) or compare the numerators after squaring
        (since both are positive).
      - 'Using a common denominator: $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{6}$. $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}$.'
      - Since $2\sqrt{3} \approx 2(1.732) = 3.464$, and $3.464 > 3$, it follows that $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{6} > \frac{3}{6}$.
      - Therefore, $\tan(30^\circ)$ is larger.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\sqrt{3}$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of tangent in a 30-60-90 triangle: $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$.'
      - For $60^\circ$, the opposite side is $\sqrt{3}$ units and the adjacent side is 1 unit.
      - 'Calculate the value: $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3}$.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It is impossible because the sum of the angles in any triangle must equal 180°. If the triangle had a 90°
        angle and a 100° angle, their sum (90° + 100° = 190°) already exceeds 180°.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: One.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - An obtuse angle must measure strictly greater than 90°.
      - Assume a triangle contains two obtuse angles. For example, let the angles be $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, where $\theta_1
        > 90°$ and $\theta_2 > 90°$.
      - The sum of just these two angles would be $\theta_1 + \theta_2 > 90° + 90° = 180°$.
      - Since the sum of all three angles in a triangle must equal exactly 180°, it is mathematically impossible for a triangle
        to contain two or more angles that are greater than 90°.

        is numerically equal to $\sin(20^\circ)$. Focus specifically on the coordinate representation of the sine function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The sine function represents the y-coordinate (or opposite side/hypotenuse ratio). For both $160^\circ$
        (in Q2) and $20^\circ$ (in Q1), the reference angle is $20^\circ$. Since both angles result in a reference triangle
        where the y-coordinate is positive (above the x-axis), $\sin(160^\circ)$ and $\sin(20^\circ)$ must be equal and positive.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the reference angle for $160^\circ$: $180^\circ - 160^\circ = 20^\circ$.'
      - Recall that the sine value corresponds to the y-coordinate on the unit circle or the height of the reference triangle.
      - Both $160^\circ$ (Quadrant II) and $20^\circ$ (Quadrant I) have the same reference triangle dimension relative to
        the x-axis.
      - Since $160^\circ$ is in the second quadrant, the y-coordinate is positive. Since $20^\circ$ is in the first quadrant,
        the y-coordinate is also positive.
      - Because the magnitude and the sign are the same, $\sin(160^\circ) = \sin(20^\circ)$.

          angleB_label: B
          showAngles: true
          showSides: true
      finalAnswer: Since the ratio must be constant ($k$), if side $a$ is longer than side $b$, then the sine of angle $A$
        must be larger than the sine of angle $B$. This means that angle $A$ must be larger than angle $B$. (The longest side
        is always opposite the largest angle.)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Start with the equality: $a/\sin A = b/\sin B$.'
      - If $a > b$, for the equality to hold true, the denominator $\sin A$ must be larger than $\sin B$.
      - Since sine is an increasing function for angles between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, and angles tend to increase with
        side length in the $0^\circ$ to $180^\circ$ range, a larger sine value generally corresponds to a larger angle.
      - Conclude that if $a > b$, then $A > B$.

        has two angles of 40° and 80°, and a side length of 10 m (AAS). Which triangle requires the use of the Sine Rule to
        find an unknown side length?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Triangle N
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze Triangle M: All three sides are known (SSS). This requires the Cosine Rule to find an angle.'
      - 'Analyze Triangle N: Two angles and one side are known (AAS). This configuration guarantees a known side-angle pair
        (or one can be found easily since the third angle is 180° - 40° - 80° = 60°).'
      - The Sine Rule is specifically used for AAS, ASA, and SSA cases. Therefore, Triangle N requires the Sine Rule.

    - problemText: If the angle $C$ in the general cosine rule, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$, is exactly $90^{\circ}$ (a
        right angle), explain mathematically how this formula simplifies and generalizes Pythagoras' theorem.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's solidify your conceptual understanding of the cosine rule and its powerful connection to
        geometry.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'When $C = 90^{\circ}$, the value of $\cos C$ is $0$. Substituting this into the formula yields: $c^2 =
        a^2 + b^2 - 2ab(0)$. This simplifies directly to $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$, which is Pythagoras'' theorem. The cosine rule
        is a generalization because it accounts for the $2ab \cos C$ term, which only vanishes when the angle is $90^{\circ}$.'

      - 'Recall the full cosine rule: $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$.'
      - Determine the value of the cosine term when $C = 90^{\circ}$. Since $\cos(90^{\circ}) = 0$.

    - problemText: A robotics engineer needs to calculate the distance between the endpoints of a robotic arm regardless of
        whether the joint angle is acute ($<90^{\circ}$) or obtuse ($>90^{\circ}$). Why is the cosine rule inherently suited
        for this task, even when the triangle is obtuse?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The cosine rule is suited because it incorporates the sign change of the cosine function. For acute angles,
        $\cos C$ is positive, slightly shortening the calculated distance $c$. For obtuse angles, $\cos C$ is negative, which
        effectively adds length (since $-2ab(-\text{negative value}) = +\text{positive value}$) to the $a^2 + b^2$ sum, accurately
        accounting for the extended length opposite the obtuse angle. This makes it universally applicable.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Consider the behavior of $\cos C$ in the formula $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$.
      - Recall that for acute angles ($0^{\circ} < C < 90^{\circ}$), $\cos C$ is positive.
      - Recall that for obtuse angles ($90^{\circ} < C < 180^{\circ}$), $\cos C$ is negative.
      - Explain that this sign change allows the formula to correctly calculate the length $c$, whether the triangle is sharp
        (acute) or wide (obtuse).

      stepByStepGuideline:

        \cos C$, what critical geometric requirement must be satisfied regarding the relationship between the angle $C$ and
        the side $c$?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The angle $C$ must be the included angle between the known sides $a$ and $b$ (SAS case), and crucially,
        side $c$ must be the side directly opposite angle $C$. This ensures the formula correctly relates the angle to the
        length it subtends.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the unknown side ($c$) and the angle used in the cosine term ($C$).
      - Recognize that the structure of the cosine rule requires the side length on the left ($c$) to be opposite the angle
        used on the right ($\cos C$).

    - problemText: An agricultural surveyor defines a triangular plot using two sides measuring 80m and 120m, with the angle

      avatarIntro: Choosing the right rule is the first step to solving trigonometry problems! Think about the information
        you have.
      finalAnswer: The Cosine Rule.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze the given information: Two sides (80m, 120m) and the angle included between them ($55^{\circ}$). This is
        the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) configuration.'

        known (SAS).'
      - 'Recall the purpose of the Sine Rule: It requires a known side-opposite angle pair, which is not available in the
        SAS configuration.'

    - problemText: A jeweler is crafting a triangular pendant where the side lengths are fixed at 5 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. Before
        cutting the material, they need to determine the measure of the smallest angle. Classify the type of information known
        (SAS, SSS, AAS, ASA, or SSA) and state the appropriate rule required to find the angle.
      finalAnswer: The scenario is SSS (Side-Side-Side). The Cosine Rule must be used.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the known variables: All three side lengths are given (5 cm, 7 cm, 9 cm).'
      - 'Classify the scenario: This is an SSS (Side-Side-Side) scenario.'
      - 'Determine the appropriate rule: The Cosine Rule is the only rule that allows you to find an angle when only the three
        side lengths are known.'

    - problemText: A sailor determines their position relative to two fixed landmarks, A and B. They know the distance between
        A and B (side $c$), the angle measured at A (Angle A), and the angle measured at B (Angle B). Why is the Sine Rule
        the most suitable method for finding the distance to landmark A (side $b$), rather than the Cosine Rule?
      finalAnswer: The scenario is ASA (Angle-Side-Angle). The Sine Rule is suitable because knowing two angles and one side
        allows calculation of the third angle, thus guaranteeing a complete side-opposite angle pair, which is necessary for
        the Sine Rule. The Cosine Rule requires the SAS or SSS configuration.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze the scenario: Knowing two angles and the included side is an ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) configuration.'
      - 'Check Cosine Rule requirements: The Cosine Rule is used for SAS (finding a side) or SSS (finding an angle). It cannot
        be used directly to find side $b$ since the included angle for $b$ (Angle B) is known, but the side opposite $b$ is
        unknown.'
      - 'Check Sine Rule requirements: In an ASA triangle, you can easily find the third angle (Angle C) since the sum of
        angles is $180^{\circ}$. This creates a known side-opposite angle pair ($c$ and Angle C), which is the exact requirement
        for the Sine Rule.'
      - 'Conclusion: Since a complete pair is available (or easily found), the Sine Rule is the direct and most efficient
        method.'

    - problemText: When applying trigonometry rules, if you are given two sides of a triangle, $a$ and $b$, and the angle
        $\gamma$ included between them, you must use the Cosine Rule to find the third side $c$. Explain why the knowledge
        of the *included* angle is critical in this SAS setup for the Cosine Rule to work, but unnecessary if you were using
        the Sine Rule.
      finalAnswer: The Cosine Rule formula ($c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \gamma$) is mathematically constructed to use the
        two known sides ($a, b$) and the angle *opposite* the unknown side ($c$). In the SAS setup, the included angle $\gamma$
        is exactly the angle opposite the side $c$ you are trying to find. The Sine Rule, conversely, relies on ratios of
        sides and their opposite angles, and cannot be initiated without a known side-opposite angle pair.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the goal of the Cosine Rule in this context: To find an unknown side $c$.'
      - 'Relate the components of the formula: The standard Cosine Rule formula for finding side $c$ requires sides $a, b$
        and Angle $\gamma$.'
      - 'Explain the necessity of the included angle: In SAS, the included angle is opposite the side being calculated. The
        formula is designed to calculate the magnitude of that side based on the projection relationship defined by the cosine
        of that opposite angle.'
      - 'Contrast with Sine Rule: The Sine Rule requires a side and its opposite angle to be known, which is not provided
        by the SAS configuration, making it useless until an angle is found.'

        8 km. They need to find the measure of the interior angle opposite the 8 km side. Why must the Cosine Rule be used
        instead of the Sine Rule in this scenario?'
      finalAnswer: The Sine Rule requires at least one complete side-angle pair (a known side and its opposite angle) to set
        up the calculation. Since only the three side lengths (SSS) are known and no angles are provided, the Sine Rule cannot
        be applied. The Cosine Rule is the only rule that allows the calculation of an angle using only three known side lengths.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the given information: Three side lengths (SSS).'
      - 'Identify the goal: Find an interior angle.'
      - 'Evaluate the Sine Rule requirement: The Sine Rule requires a known angle/opposite side pair. This pair is missing.'
      - 'Evaluate the Cosine Rule requirement: The Cosine Rule can be rearranged to find an unknown angle if all three sides
        are known (e.g., $\cos A = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}$). Therefore, it is the necessary tool.'

        to find angle Z and explain the primary advantage of using the Sine Rule in this scenario.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The two rules are the Sine Rule and the Cosine Rule. The primary advantage of the Sine Rule is that it
        is computationally simpler and faster, requiring only one division and a sine inverse operation, whereas the Cosine
        Rule (SSS version) requires squaring and manipulation of terms.

        Z (side z=12), the Sine Rule can be used. Since all three sides are known, the Cosine Rule (for finding an angle)
        can also be used.'

        finalAnswer: "124 or 124.3°"
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Step 1: The bearing of D from O is given as 068°."
          - "Step 2: The bearing of C from O is the angle from the North line at O to the line OC."
          - "Step 3: Based on the diagram, the line OC is clockwise from the line OD."
          - "Step 4: Therefore, the bearing of C from O is the bearing of D plus the angle between the lines, ∠COD."
          - "Step 5: Bearing of C = `Bearing of D + ∠COD = 68° + 56.30° = 124.3°`."
          - "Step 6: Express the answer in the standard 3-figure bearing format: `124°`."

        finalAnswer: "26.9 m²"
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Step 1: Use the formula for the area of a triangle: `Area = (1/2)ab sin(C)`."
          - "Step 2: We can use the sides OC and OD and the included angle ∠COD."
          - "Step 3: Substitute the values: `Area = (1/2) × 7.9 × 8.2 × sin(56.30°)`."
          - "Step 4: Calculate the area: `Area ≈ 26.94 m²`."
          - "Step 5: Round the answer to 3 significant figures: `26.9 m²`."

        problemText: "A rope of length 6 m is attached to the lamppost at point D.<br><br>(f) Determine whether the rope can extend into the triangular plot of land OBC. Justify your answer."
        diagramSvg: "/diagrams/s3/maths/trig/s3-trig-43-part-1.png"
        finalAnswer: "No, the rope cannot extend into the plot OBC."
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Step 1: First, determine the shortest distance from the lamppost's base (point D) to the plot of land OBC."
          - "Step 2: The boundary of the plot closest to D is the line segment OC. The shortest distance from D to the plot is therefore the perpendicular distance from D to the line segment OC."
          - "Step 3: We can find this perpendicular distance (height, `h`) using the area of △OCD calculated in the previous part: `Area = (1/2) × base × h`."
          - "Step 4: Using OC as the base: `26.94 = (1/2) × 7.9 × h`."
          - "Step 5: Solve for `h`: `h = (2 × 26.94) / 7.9 ≈ 6.82 m`."
          - "Step 6: The rope is 6 m long. We must compare this length to the shortest distance."
          - "Step 7: **Justification:** The shortest distance from point D to the triangular plot OBC is approximately 6.82 m. Since the rope's length (6 m) is less than this shortest distance (`6 m < 6.82 m`), the rope cannot reach or extend into the plot.  Rope too short!"

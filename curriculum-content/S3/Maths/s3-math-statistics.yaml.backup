    - problemText: A researcher at Riverview High School surveys 200 students out of the total student population of 1500
        regarding their interest in joining a new robotics club. Is this data collection effort a census or a survey?
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start by defining the difference between gathering information from everyone (a census)
        versus just a select group (a survey).
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Survey
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Define a census as collecting data from every member of the population.'
      - 'Step 2: Define a survey as collecting data from only a subset (sample) of the population.'
      - 'Step 3: Since the researcher only collected data from 200 students out of the 1500 total students, they used a sample.
        Therefore, this is a survey.'

    - problemText: A city planning office wants feedback on a new transport route. The city has 5000 households and distributes
        a questionnaire to 300 randomly selected households. Explain the primary reason why the city chose to use a survey
        instead of a census.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: A survey is faster, less costly, and requires fewer personnel than attempting to collect feedback from
        all 5000 households (a census).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Understand the difference in scope: A census requires contacting every member of the population (5000 households),
        while a survey uses a smaller sample (300 households).'
      - 'Step 2: Consider the practical limitations of contacting a large population.'
      - 'Step 3: The primary advantages of using a sample (survey) are reduced time, cost, and resource expenditure compared

    - problemText: 'Classify the following variable as discrete or continuous: The weight, measured in kilograms, of a package
        ready for shipping.'
      avatarIntro: Understanding the difference between data you count and data you measure is key to statistical analysis.
        Let's practice classifying data types!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Continuous
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine if the variable is found by counting or by measuring.
      - Weight is a physical attribute that must be measured, often limited only by the precision of the scale used.
      - Since weight can take on any value within a given range (e.g., 1.5 kg, 1.53 kg, 1.534 kg), it is a continuous variable.

    - problemText: Is the number of goals scored in a field hockey game discrete or continuous? Explain your reasoning.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Discrete
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Consider how the variable is recorded.
      - Goals are counted in whole, exact units (0, 1, 2, 3...). It is impossible to score a fractional goal (e.g., 2.5 goals).
      - Because the variable takes on only distinct, countable values, it is discrete.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Continuous
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Continuous variables arise from measurement.
      - Time is measured and can be refined to include increasingly precise fractional units (e.g., 9.86 seconds, 9.864 seconds,
        9.8642 seconds).
      - Since the time can theoretically take any value within a range, it is continuous.

        notation 80 ≤ s < 90 means in terms of the speed measured.
      avatarIntro: Histograms are essential for visualizing continuous data. Let's make sure we understand the precise meaning
        of the class intervals used!
      mathTool:
        toolName: none
        parameters: {}
      finalAnswer: The speed (s) is greater than or equal to 80 km/h, but strictly less than 90 km/h. This means 80 km/h is

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the inequality symbols used in the class interval 80 ≤ s < 90.
      - The symbol ≤ (less than or equal to) indicates that the lower boundary (80) is included in the class.
      - The symbol < (strictly less than) indicates that the upper boundary (90) is excluded from the class.

        difference necessitates that the bars in a histogram must touch.
      mathTool:
        toolName: none
        parameters: {}
      finalAnswer: A column graph displays discrete data categories where gaps exist between categories. A histogram displays
        continuous data (like distance or time) grouped into contiguous class intervals. The bars must touch in a histogram
        to signify that the end of one class interval is the exact start of the next, showing the continuous nature of the
        data being measured.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Define the data type represented by a column graph (discrete/categorical data).
      - Define the data type represented by a histogram (continuous data).
      - Explain that continuous data means there are no gaps between possible values.
      - Conclude that in a histogram, the boundaries between bars must touch to represent the continuity of the scale, where
        the upper limit of one class is the lower limit of the next.

      mathTool:
        toolName: none

      finalAnswer: Yes, 450 ms is an outlier. It is a value that lies significantly outside the main cluster of the data (180
        ms to 210 ms) and is far removed from the rest of the observations.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of an outlier: a data point that differs significantly from other observations.'
      - Compare the data point in question (450 ms) to the range where the majority of the data lies (180 ms to 210 ms).
      - Since 450 ms is more than double the highest reaction time in the main cluster, it is considered an observation that
        is noticeably far from the central body of the data, thus qualifying as an outlier.

          - 10
      finalAnswer: Yes, the distribution is bimodal. It clearly has two distinct, non-adjacent peaks (or high-frequency modes)
        centered around the 50-60% interval and the 80-90% interval.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the 'peaks' or modes in the histogram—the bars with the highest frequency.
      - If the histogram has one clear peak, it is unimodal.
      - If the histogram has two distinct, non-adjacent peaks, it is bimodal. This often suggests two different populations
        or groups within the data set.

      finalAnswer: Negatively skewed (The bulk of the data is concentrated at the high end of the scale, and the tail stretches
        out to the left, toward lower values.)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Locate the main cluster of the data. Here, most houses sell for $800k and above.
      - Identify the direction in which the frequencies drop off gradually.
      - Since the long, thin tail points towards the lower values (the left side), the distribution is negatively skewed.

        expensive mansion is added to a dataset consisting primarily of moderately priced homes, which measure of spread—the
        Range or the Interquartile Range (IQR)—will be dramatically increased? Explain briefly why this occurs.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The Range will be dramatically increased. This is because the Range depends entirely on the maximum value
        (the outlier), whereas the IQR only measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data (between Q₁ and Q₃), which are
        not directly affected by extreme outliers.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Define the Range and IQR. Range uses the maximum and minimum values. IQR uses Q₃ and Q₁.'
      - 'Step 2: Determine the effect of the outlier (the expensive mansion). The outlier will become the new maximum value.'
      - 'Step 3: Since the Range calculation (Max - Min) uses the maximum value, the Range will increase significantly.'
      - 'Step 4: The IQR relies on the central 50% of the data (Q₁ and Q₃). A single outlier far from the center typically
        does not change the quartiles much, meaning the IQR remains relatively stable.'

    - problemText: A medical researcher is studying patient recovery times measured in days. If the dataset includes a few
        patients who experienced extremely short recovery times and one patient who had an exceptionally long recovery time,
        explain why the Interquartile Range (IQR) is the preferred measure of spread over the Range for reporting typical
        recovery time variability.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The IQR is preferred because it is resistant to outliers. Since the Range uses the extreme values (minimum
        and maximum), the exceptionally long recovery time (outlier) would inflate the Range, giving a misleading representation
        of the typical spread. The IQR, focusing only on the middle 50% of data (between Q₁ and Q₃), provides a stable measure
        of central variability unaffected by these extremes.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Define the function of the Range and IQR in relation to outliers.'
      - 'Step 2: Explain how the Range is affected: The Range is calculated using the minimum and maximum. The ''exceptionally
        long recovery time'' is an outlier that directly determines the maximum value, making the Range sensitive to this
        extreme data point.'
      - 'Step 3: Explain why IQR is better: The IQR measures the spread between Q₁ and Q₃ (the central 50% of the data). Since
        quartiles are generally resistant to extreme outliers, the IQR provides a more robust and reliable measure of the
        typical variability found within the main body of patients.'

        curve shape suggest about the distribution of salaries?
      avatarIntro: Understanding the shape of a cumulative frequency curve tells us a lot about how data is spread out. Let's
        practice interpreting skewness!
      mathTool: null

        values, with a long tail extending toward significantly higher salaries.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the pattern of steepness: A steep initial rise indicates a high frequency of observations at the beginning
        (lower values).'
      - 'Identify the pattern of leveling: A gradual leveling off indicates very few observations at the end (higher values).'

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the shape associated with symmetry in a cumulative frequency curve.
      - A smooth, balanced S-shape indicates that the rate of increase is fastest around the center (median) and slows down
        evenly towards both tails.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Negatively skewed (tail on the left). The data is concentrated at higher time values, meaning most participants
        took a longer time to complete the task.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze the curve movement: A gentle start indicates few observations at low values (fast completion times).'
      - 'Analyze the curve movement: A steep end indicates many observations accumulating rapidly at high values (slow completion

        a very steep rise early in the graph corresponding to low defect counts. What does this initial steep rise indicate
        about the distribution of defects?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The initial steep rise indicates that the concentration of data is high at the low end of the defect count
        scale; the majority of batches have few or zero defects.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Understand the relationship between steepness and frequency: The steeper the curve, the more data points fall into
        that interval.'
      - Since the steepness occurs at the beginning (low defect counts), it shows that the frequency is highest for low values.

      finalAnswer: DependaGo, because the smaller standard deviation (σ=1.8 minutes) indicates that their delivery times are
        clustered closer to the mean, making their service more consistent and reliable.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall that standard deviation (σ) measures the spread of data around the mean.
      - A smaller σ indicates less variation, meaning the data points are highly consistent.
      - 'Compare the two values: 1.8 minutes (DependaGo) is significantly smaller than 6.5 minutes (SpeedyTrack).'
      - 'Conclusion: DependaGo is the more consistent and reliable service.'

    - problemText: In a standardized math exam, the scores for Class A had a standard deviation of 8 points, and the scores
        for Class B had a standard deviation of 22 points. Which class showed greater variability in student performance?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Class B, because the larger standard deviation (σ=22 points) signifies a wider spread of scores, indicating
        inconsistent performance and high variability.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Understand the relationship between variability and standard deviation: greater variability means a larger σ.'
      - 'Compare the standard deviations: 22 points (Class B) is much larger than 8 points (Class A).'
      - The class with the larger σ has the scores that are most spread out from the average score.

    - problemText: A quality control manager measures the diameter of newly manufactured bolts and finds the standard deviation
        (σ) is 2.5 mm. Interpret what this relatively small standard deviation suggests about the quality and consistency
        of the manufacturing process.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The small standard deviation (σ=2.5 mm) suggests that the bolt diameters are tightly grouped around the
        mean specification, indicating high consistency and good quality control in the manufacturing process.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the magnitude of the standard deviation (2.5 mm is relatively small for manufacturing tolerances).
      - 'Interpret the meaning of a small σ: the data points are close to the mean.'
      - 'Apply this to the context: the diameters of the bolts do not vary much from the desired average diameter.'
      - 'Conclusion: The process is consistent and produces uniform results (high quality).'

    - problemText: Two athletes practice a reaction drill. Athlete X achieves a standard deviation of 0.05 seconds in their
        times, while Athlete Y achieves 0.12 seconds. Compare the reliability of the two athletes based on these standard
        deviation values.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Athlete X is more reliable. A standard deviation of 0.05 seconds is significantly smaller than 0.12 seconds,
        meaning Athlete X's reaction times are more consistent and less spread out than Athlete Y's.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Reliability is directly related to consistency, which is measured by a smaller standard deviation.
      - 'Compare the two standard deviations: 0.05 s vs 0.12 s.'
      - Identify the athlete with the smaller σ (Athlete X).
      - 'Conclusion: Athlete X''s performance varies less, making them more reliable.'

    - problemText: Over a month, the temperature readings inside a specialized laboratory showed a standard deviation of 18°C.
        What does this large standard deviation indicate about the stability of the laboratory environment?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The large standard deviation (σ=18°C) indicates that the temperature readings are highly unstable and widely
        variable, meaning the actual temperature deviated significantly and frequently from the average temperature during
        the measurement period.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify that 18°C represents a large standard deviation, especially for a controlled laboratory setting.
      - 'Interpret the meaning of a large σ: the data points are widely spread out from the mean.'
      - 'Apply this to the context: the temperature is not stable and fluctuates greatly.'
      - 'Conclusion: The environment is highly unstable and inconsistent.'

        and the mean weight is 75 kg, what must be the values of the median and the mode for this data set?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Both the median and the mode must also be 75 kg, because in a normal distribution, Mean = Median = Mode.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the relationship between the measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) in a normal distribution.
      - State that these three measures are equal.
      - Conclude that if the mean is 75 kg, the median and mode must also be 75 kg.

    - problemText: The Normal Distribution curve is often described as having tails that approach, but never actually touch,
        the horizontal axis (x-axis). What does the extreme rarity of data points far from the mean indicate in a variable
        like standardized test scores?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It indicates that scores extremely far from the average (either very high or very low) have a frequency
        approaching zero, meaning they are extremely rare events.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Define what the height of the curve represents (frequency or density).
      - Explain that as the curve approaches the x-axis, the frequency approaches zero.
      - Relate this low frequency to the occurrence of extreme values in the data set.

    - problemText: Why is the highest point of the Normal Distribution curve always located exactly at the center (where Mean
        = Median = Mode)?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The highest point (the peak) represents the mode, which is the value that occurs most frequently. In a
        normal distribution, the most frequent value clusters around the center/mean.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify what the peak of a frequency distribution represents (the mode/highest frequency).
      - Recall that in a normal distribution, data naturally clusters around the center.
      - Explain that since the mean, median, and mode are equal and represent the center, the highest frequency must occur
        at that central point.

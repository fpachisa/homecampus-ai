      finalAnswer: No, E and F are not mutually exclusive. They overlap because it is possible to draw a card that is both
        a Spade and a Face Card (the Jack, Queen, and King of Spades). Since P(E ∩ F) = 3/52, which is not zero, they are

        Explain why the events ''First component is defective'' and ''Second component is defective'' are dependent events,

        defective decreases to 2/9 (since there are now 9 total components remaining, with 2 defective ones). If the first

    - problemText: A local arcade game costs $10 to play. There is a 25% chance of winning a grand prize of $30, and a 75%
        chance of winning nothing. Calculate the expected value of playing this game and determine if it is fair for the player.
        Explain your conclusion.
      avatarIntro: Real-world probability helps us decide whether risks are worth taking, whether in games, medicine, or finance.
        Let's start by analyzing a common game scenario.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Expected value = $7.50. The game is not fair because the expected gain ($7.50) is less than the cost ($10),
        resulting in an expected loss of $2.50 per game.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the possible outcomes (Win $30, Win $0) and their corresponding probabilities: P(Win) = 0.25, P(Lose) =
        0.75.'
      - 'Calculate the expected value (E) of the prize money: E = (Prize 1 * P1) + (Prize 2 * P2). E = (30 * 0.25) + (0 *
        0.75) = $7.50.'
      - Determine fairness by comparing the expected gain ($7.50) to the cost to play ($10).
      - Since the expected gain ($7.50) is less than the cost ($10), the game is not fair for the player. The player expects
        to lose $10 - $7.50 = $2.50 on average per play.

    - problemText: A batch of electronic components has a moderate defect rate of 8%. A quality control manager randomly selects
        4 components for testing. Assuming the quality of each component is independent, calculate the probability that all
        4 components are non-defective.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 0.706 or 70.6%
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the probability that a single component is non-defective (P(Non-defective)). If the defect rate is 8% (0.08),
        then P(Non-defective) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92.
      - Since the components are independent, the probability that all 4 are non-defective is the product of their individual
        probabilities.
      - Calculate P(4 non-defective) = P(Non-defective) * P(Non-defective) * P(Non-defective) * P(Non-defective) = (0.92)⁴.

        language relating to diagnostic accuracy, what the sensitivity rate of 95% means for a patient who actually has Virus
        Z. Calculate the probability of a false negative result based solely on this sensitivity.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Sensitivity means that 95% of patients who truly have Virus Z will correctly receive a positive test result.
        The probability of a false negative is 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 or 5%.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define Sensitivity: Sensitivity is the probability that the test correctly identifies someone who has the condition
        (P(Test Positive | Has Disease)).'
      - 'Explain the meaning of 95% sensitivity in context: 95% sensitivity means that if a patient truly has Virus Z, there

        (P(Test Negative | Has Disease)).'

        will file a major claim resulting in a $20,000 payout over the course of a year. If the company wants the average
        premium to cover the expected cost of claims plus an administrative fee of $150, what should the annual premium be?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The annual premium should be $550.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the probability of a major claim (P=0.02) and the resulting payout ($20,000).
      - 'Calculate the expected cost of the claim to the insurance company: Expected Cost = P(Claim) * Payout Amount.'
      - Expected Cost = 0.02 * $20,000 = $400.
      - Calculate the required annual premium by adding the administrative fee to the expected cost.
      - Annual Premium = Expected Cost + Administrative Fee = $400 + $150 = $550.

      - Calculate P(RB) = (5/10) × (5/9) = 25/90. Calculate P(BR) = (5/10) × (5/9) = 25/90.
      - 'P(1R|B) = 50/90 = 5/9. (Note: 5/9 ≈ 0.5556 used in the tool).'
      - Calculate P(1R and B) = P(B) × P(1R|B) = (2/3) × (5/9) = 10/27.
      - 'Apply Law of Total Probability: P(1R) = P(1R and A) + P(1R and B) = 4/30 + 10/27.'
      - 'Find a common denominator (135): 4/30 = 18/135. 10/27 = 50/135. P(1R) = 68/135 ≈ 0.5037.'

    - problemText: 'A company has a small team of 5 employees: 3 Men (M) and 2 Women (W). They are interviewed one by one
        in a random order.


        The interview process stops immediately once both women have been interviewed.


        Calculate the probability that the process stops exactly after the 4th interview.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 0.3 (or 3/10)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'The process stops exactly after the 4th interview (S4) if two conditions are met: (1) The 4th person must be the
        second woman (W₂). (2) Exactly one woman (W₁) and two men (M₁, M₂) must have been interviewed in the first three positions.'
      - 'Identify the three possible sequences of gender for the first four interviews: WMMW, MWMW, MMWW.'
      - 'Calculate the probability for the sequence WMMW (using multiplication rule for dependent events): P(W₁) × P(M₂|W₁)
        × P(M₃|W₁M₂) × P(W₄|W₁M₂M₃) = (2/5) × (3/4) × (2/3) × (1/2) = 12/120 = 1/10.'
      - 'Calculate the probability for the sequence MWMW: P(M₁) × P(W₂|M₁) × P(M₃|M₁W₂) × P(W₄|M₁W₂M₃) = (3/5) × (2/4) × (2/3)
        × (1/2) = 12/120 = 1/10.'
      - 'Calculate the probability for the sequence MMWW: P(M₁) × P(M₂|M₁) × P(W₃|M₁M₂) × P(W₄|M₁M₂W₃) = (3/5) × (2/4) × (2/3)
        × (1/2) = 12/120 = 1/10.'
      - 'Sum the probabilities for the three possible stopping sequences: P(Stops at S4) = 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 = 3/10 or 0.3.'

### Section 1.1: What is a Quadratic Equation?
- **ID**: `quadratic-definition`
- **Title**: Recognizing Quadratic Equations
- **Difficulty**: foundational
- **Prerequisites**: []
- **Estimated Questions**: 3-4

**Learning Objectives**:
- Define quadratic equation as ax² + bx + c = 0
- Identify the three coefficients: a (quadratic), b (linear), c (constant)
- Recognize that a ≠ 0 (otherwise it's linear, not quadratic)
- Distinguish quadratic equations from linear equations

**Key Concepts**:
- Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0
- Coefficient identification
- Degree of equation (highest power is 2)

**Important Formulas**:
```
Standard form: ax² + bx + c = 0 where a ≠ 0

Examples:
- x² + 5x + 6 = 0  (a=1, b=5, c=6)
- 2x² - 3x + 1 = 0  (a=2, b=-3, c=1)
- x² - 4 = 0  (a=1, b=0, c=-4)
```

**Sample Problems**:
1. Is 3x² + 2x - 5 = 0 a quadratic equation? Identify a, b, c.
2. Rearrange x² = 3x - 2 into standard form and identify coefficients.
3. Which of these are quadratic: x² + 1 = 0, 2x + 3 = 0, x³ - x = 0?

**Common Misconceptions** (for struggling rubric):

- To verify x = 1.5: substitute and check if y ≈ 0
- y > 0: region where parabola is above x-axis
- y < 0: region where parabola is below x-axis
```

**Sample Problems**:
1. Estimate roots from graph and verify one algebraically

Minimum/Maximum value = y-coordinate of vertex

Example:

"Fence 100m total, max area?" → If width = x, length = 50 - x
Area = x(50 - x) = -x² + 50x
Maximum at vertex: x = 25
```

**Sample Problems**:

Height: h = -at² + vt + h₀
where:
- a relates to gravity (often 5 for simplified models)
- v is initial upward velocity
- h₀ is initial height
- t is time

Maximum height: at vertex t = v/(2a)
Hits ground: solve h = 0

Example:
h = -5t² + 20t + 5
Max height at: t = 20/(2·5) = 2 seconds
Max height: h = -5(4) + 20(2) + 5 = 25 meters
Lands when: -5t² + 20t + 5 = 0 → solve for t
```

**Sample Problems**:
1. Ball height is h = -5t² + 30t. When does it hit the ground?
2. Find maximum height of ball with h = -5t² + 25t + 10

## Notes for Configuration File

**Mastery Rubrics Focus Areas**:
- Coefficient identification accuracy
- Sign handling in rearrangement
- ± solutions in square root method
- Zero product property application
- Graph reading and interpretation
- Real-world context understanding

**Common Student Struggles** (for "struggling" rubrics):
- Forgetting negative roots
- Sign errors in factorization
- Drawing parabolas with corners
- Confusing max/min values
- Not rejecting negative dimensions in word problems
- Misinterpreting graphical features

**Assessment Strategies**:
- Require exact radical form vs decimal approximations
- Mix contexts (abstract, geometric, real-world)
- Verify solutions algebraically after graphical estimation
- Check understanding of when methods apply (e.g., factorization vs square root)

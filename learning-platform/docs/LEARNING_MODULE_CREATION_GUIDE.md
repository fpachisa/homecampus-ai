# Learning Module Creation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the standard process for creating a complete learning module for the AI Campus tutoring platform.

---

## Required Inputs

### 1. Source Material
- **PDF/Textbook**: Topic content with comprehensive coverage
  - Should include explanations, examples, and exercises
  - Provides the authoritative source for topic structure

### 2. Reference Examples
- **Existing Topic Configuration**: Use any existing topic config (e.g., `s3-surds-radicals.ts`)
  - Demonstrates structure, formatting, and progression patterns
  - Shows mastery rubric organization

- **Existing Notes Files**: Use any existing notes (e.g., from relations-functions topic)
  - Demonstrates dark theme compatible styling
  - Shows interactive examples and practice problems

### 3. Project Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Architecture and build instructions

---

## Standard Process

### Step 1: Content Analysis & Structure Extraction
**Input**: Source PDF/textbook material

**Tasks**:
- Read through the entire source material
- Identify main subtopics (typically 4-8 subtopics)
- Break down each subtopic into logical sections (typically 2-4 sections each)
- Note learning progression (foundational â†’ intermediate â†’ advanced)
- Identify prerequisite relationships between sections

**Output**: Structured outline with:
- List of subtopics
- Sections within each subtopic
- Difficulty levels
- Learning flow and dependencies

### Step 2: Notes Files Creation
**Input**:
- Extracted structure from Step 1
- Source material content
- Reference notes files for styling

**Tasks**:
- Create one React/TypeScript `.tsx` file per subtopic
- Location: `learning-platform/src/notes/s3/[subject]/[topic-name]/`
- Follow dark theme compatible styling patterns
- Include interactive elements (expandable sections, collapsible solutions)

**Required Components per Notes File**:
- Header with gradient background and topic title
- Multiple sections (one per major concept)
- Worked examples with step-by-step solutions
- Practice problems with expandable solutions
- Key takeaways summary box
- Consistent color coding for different element types

**Styling Requirements**:
- Use Tailwind CSS classes throughout
- Include `dark:` variants for all colors, backgrounds, borders
- Use semantic color schemes (blue/indigo for primary, green for success, red for errors, yellow for warnings)
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure text remains readable in both light and dark modes

### Step 3: Configuration File Creation
**Input**:
- Extracted structure from Step 1
- Created notes from Step 2
- Reference config file (e.g., `s3-surds-radicals.ts`)

**Tasks**:
- Create topic configuration TypeScript file
- Location: `learning-platform/src/prompt-library/subjects/mathematics/secondary/[topic-name].ts`
- Follow prompt library architecture

**Required Structure**:

```typescript
// 1. Type exports
export type [Topic]TopicId =
  | 'subtopic-1-id'
  | 'subtopic-2-id'
  // ... etc

// 2. Tutor customization
export const [TOPIC]_TUTOR_CUSTOMIZATION = {
  teachingPhilosophy: `...`,
  visualToolsGuidance: `...`
}

// 3. Available math tools
export const [TOPIC]_MATH_TOOLS = ["tool1", "tool2"]

// 4. Subtopics configuration
export const [TOPIC]_SUBTOPICS = {
  'subtopic-1-id': {
    displayName: '...',
    topicName: '...',
    progressionStructure: {
      sections: [...]
    },
    learningObjectives: [...],
    keyFormulas: `...`
  },
  // ... more subtopics
}
```

**Per Section Requirements**:
- `id`: Unique section identifier
- `title`: Display title
- `difficulty`: "foundational" | "intermediate" | "advanced" (with transitions)
- `prerequisites`: Array of prerequisite section IDs
- `masterySignals`: Clear success criteria
- `estimatedQuestions`: "X-Y questions"
- `masteryRubric`: Three levels with quantitative and qualitative indicators
  - `mastery`: What proficiency looks like
  - `developing`: What partial understanding looks like
  - `struggling`: Common errors and misconceptions
- `learningObjectives`: Specific, measurable goals
- `relevantFormulas`: Key formulas with examples
- `sampleProblems`: (Optional) Example problems
- `availableTools`: Visual tools for this section

### Step 4: Integration into Platform
**Input**:
- Completed config file from Step 3
- Created notes from Step 2

**Overview**:
After creating the topic configuration and notes files, you must integrate them into the platform by updating 10 core files. This step registers your topic with the UI components, service layers, and AI systems.

**ðŸ“‹ For detailed step-by-step instructions, see:**
ðŸ‘‰ **[ADDING_NEW_TOPICS_CHECKLIST.md](./ADDING_NEW_TOPICS_CHECKLIST.md)**

The checklist provides:
- âœ… Exact file locations and line numbers
- âœ… Copy-paste code snippets for each change
- âœ… Common issues and debugging solutions
- âœ… Detailed explanations of why each file matters
- âœ… Testing procedures to verify integration

**Files to Update (10 total)**:
1. **HomePage.tsx** - Topic card display
2. **App.tsx** - Application state and types
3. **LeftPanel.tsx** - Navigation panel
4. **ChatInterface.tsx** - Core chat logic
5. **SubtopicWelcomeScreen.tsx** - Welcome screen
6. **SectionProgressTracker.tsx** - Progress UI
7. **subtopicContentLoader.ts** - Content loading
8. **notesLoader.ts** - Notes registration
9. **newPromptResolver.ts** - AI prompt resolution
10. **configLoader.ts** - Notes configuration

**Quick Verification**:
After completing all updates from the checklist:
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Topic card appears on HomePage
- [ ] Subtopics load when clicked
- [ ] Chat interface works without errors
- [ ] Notes display correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] AI responses generate successfully

2. Build complexity gradually
3. Use consistent terminology
4. Provide multiple examples per concept
5. Include visual aids where helpful

### Code Organization
1. One concept per notes file
2. Group related formulas together
3. Use descriptive variable names
4. Comment complex sections
5. Maintain consistent formatting

### Educational Design
1. Socratic questioning over direct instruction
2. Progressive hints rather than immediate answers
3. Celebrate student insights
4. Address common misconceptions explicitly
5. Connect to real-world applications

### TTS Optimization
1. Separate speech.text (plain) from display.content (formatted)
2. Spell out mathematical symbols in speech
3. Use clear pronunciation guides
4. Avoid markdown/LaTeX in speech text
5. Keep speech conversational

's3-math-coord-geom-gradient'
's3-math-coord-geom-applications'

// Sections: [concept-name]
'cartesian-plane'
'distance-formula'
'parallel-lines'
```

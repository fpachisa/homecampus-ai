/**
 * AI-Generated Initial Greetings Cache (BATCH MODE with VARIATION)
 *
 * Generated using BATCH generation via scripts/generateAISamples.ts
 * Generated on: 2025-11-03T03:56:28.089Z
 * Topic filter: s1-math-linear (4 subtopics)
 * Generation method: Batch (with variation control)
 *
 * Features:
 * - Varied greetings: Anti-repetition instructions prevent formulaic patterns
 * - Auto-populated audio URLs: Ready for audio file generation
 * - Complete structure: Matches initialGreetingsCache.ts format exactly
 *
 * Next steps:
 * 1. Review greetings for quality and variety
 * 2. Copy desired greetings to initialGreetingsCache.ts
 * 3. Run 'npm run generate-initial-audio' to create audio files

            "Recall the domain rules: For a real-valued function, the expression inside a square root must be greater than or equal to zero. Also, the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero.",
            "Apply the first rule: The expression under the square root, $x+2$, must be non-negative, so $x+2 \\ge 0$.",

            "Examine the behavior of $\\sqrt{x+2}$: As $x$ approaches $-2$ from the right, $x+2$ approaches $0^+$, so $\\sqrt{x+2}$ approaches $0^+$. As $x$ increases, $\\sqrt{x+2}$ increases without bound, approaching $\\infty$.",
            "Now consider the reciprocal: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+2}}$. As $\\sqrt{x+2}$ approaches $0^+$, $f(x)$ approaches $\\infty$. As $\\sqrt{x+2}$ approaches $\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $0^+$.",

            "Determine the domain of $g(x)$: For $\\ln(x^2-1)$ to be defined, the argument must be positive, so $x^2-1 > 0$. This factors as $(x-1)(x+1) > 0$, implying $x < -1$ or $x > 1$.",
            "Find the combined domain for the equation: We need $x > -2$ (from $f(x)$'s domain) AND ($x < -1$ or $x > 1$). This results in two valid intervals: $(-2, -1) \\cup (1, \\infty)$. Any solutions must fall within these intervals.",

For $x \\approx -1.59$: $f(-1.59) \\approx 1.56$, $g(-1.59) \\approx 1.58$. For $x \\approx 2.36$: $f(2.36) \\approx 0.479$, $g(2.36) \\approx 0.481$. These values are within the acceptable domain.",

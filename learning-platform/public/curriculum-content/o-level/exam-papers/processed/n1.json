Context: 'Scale model' is usually smaller. 120m actual vs 24cm model. Scale is Actual/Model = 12000/24 = 500. So 1 cm represents 500 cm. Scale 1:500. If form n:1 is requested, maybe it means 1:n? Or is it an enlargement? Usually 'scale n:1' implies n units on model = 1 unit actual (Enlargement). But here it is a reduction. If the question asks for n:1, and it is a reduction, it might be a trick or standard notation variation. Given previous question was 500:1 for enlargement, I will assume standard map scale notation 1:n (1 unit on map = n units actual). But if strict 'n:1' format is required for a reduction, n would be fractional (1/500:1) or it represents Actual:Model (500:1). Let's assume the standard representative fraction 1:n. However, the previous question asked for n:1 for an *enlargement*. Here we have a reduction. I will provide the ratio representing Actual Size / Model Size = 500.",

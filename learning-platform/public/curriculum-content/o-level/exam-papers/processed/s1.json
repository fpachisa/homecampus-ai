The question asks for the numbers, the order in the list was $x_4, x_5$. If $x=25$ and $y=18$, we must swap them to maintain ascending order? No, the stem says 'arranged in ascending order'. If the calculation yields a number out of order, we must check if the 'Largest' definition applies to the last position or just the value.\n\nRe-evaluating: If $y$ is the largest number, $y=18$. If $x=25$, then $x$ is the largest, not $y$. This contradicts the premise that the number defined as 'twice the smallest' is the largest.\n\nLet's re-read: 'The largest number is twice the smallest'.\nSmallest = 9. Largest = 18.\nThis implies NO number can be larger than 18.\nHowever, calculation gives $x=25$. 25 > 18.\nThis implies the set of conditions is impossible OR the 'Largest number' refers to the variable we found.\n\nLet's adjust the question for the user to ensure it is solvable logically.\n\n*Self-Correction for Question Generation*: I will modify the Mean to 13 so the sum is 65.\nNew Sum = 65.\n$50 + x = 65 \\Rightarrow x = 15$.\nList: 9, 9, 14, 15, 18.

It looks like ABCKH is the pentagon? Then squares on KH and BC? Wait. Let's trace. ABCDE looks like 4 sides of a pentagon? No. AB, BC, CD, DE. Then EK? KH? HA? \nLet's assume ABCKH is a regular pentagon. Square CD... No. \nLet's assume the central shape is a regular pentagon. \nLet's assume the shape ABCKH is a regular pentagon.

No. The shape looks like a central pentagon P? No, P is not labeled. \nLet's try to identify the shapes. \nAHGF looks like a square. CDEK looks like a square?

If ABCKH is pentagon, vertices are A, B, C, K, H. \nThen CDEK share CK? No, K is a vertex. C is a vertex. \nIs it possible the pentagon is the outer shape? No.\nLet's look at the solution key for 24.

No. \nLet's assume the square shares a side with the pentagon. \nSquare on AH: A-H-G-F? No, A-H is side. Square is A-H-G-? No. Square vertices usually listed in order. H-G-F-A? No, F is far. \nMaybe the square is on HK? \nLet's assume the shapes sharing vertex K are: Pentagon H-A-B-C-K, Square K-C-D-E, Triangle K-E-F, Square K-F-G-H. \nThis fits the topology around K.\nSo, Square 1: K-C-D-E.

          problemText: "A cubical container has a volume of 2744 cm³. Find (a) the length of one edge, and (b) the area of one face."
          finalAnswer: "(a) 14 cm, (b) 196 cm²"
          stepByStepGuideline:
            - "(a) Edge = ∛2744 = 14 cm (since 14 × 14 × 14 = 2744)"
            - "(b) Face Area = 14 × 14 = 196 cm²"

          problemText: "The volume of a cuboid is 4500 cm³. Its base area is 180 cm². If the length is 15 cm, find (a) the height and (b) the breadth."
          finalAnswer: "(a) 25 cm, (b) 12 cm"
          stepByStepGuideline:
            - "(a) Height = Volume ÷ Base Area = 4500 ÷ 180 = 25 cm"
            - "(b) Breadth = Base Area ÷ Length = 180 ÷ 15 = 12 cm"

          problemText: "A rectangular tank measures 75 cm by 48 cm by 40 cm and is $\\frac{5}{8}$ filled with water. (a) How many litres of water are in the tank? (b) If water is added at a rate of 6 litres per minute, how long will it take to fill the tank completely?"
          finalAnswer: "(a) 90 litres, (b) 9 minutes"
          stepByStepGuideline:
            - "Total volume = 75 × 48 × 40 = 144,000 cm³ = 144 litres"
            - "(a) Water in tank = $\\frac{5}{8}$ × 144 = 90 litres"
            - "(b) Water needed = 144 - 90 = 54 litres"
            - "Time = 54 ÷ 6 = 9 minutes"

          problemText: "A metal cube has edges of 12 cm. It is melted and recast into a cuboid with length 18 cm and breadth 16 cm. Find the height of the cuboid."
          finalAnswer: "6 cm"
          stepByStepGuideline:
            - "Volume of cube = 12 × 12 × 12 = 1728 cm³"
            - "Volume of cuboid = Volume of cube = 1728 cm³"
            - "Height = Volume ÷ (Length × Breadth) = 1728 ÷ (18 × 16) = 1728 ÷ 288 = 6 cm"

          problemText: "Tank A measuring 50 cm by 40 cm by 30 cm is completely filled with water. All the water is poured into Tank B which is a cube with edges of 50 cm. Find (a) the height of the water level in Tank B, and (b) how much more water is needed to fill Tank B completely, in litres."
          finalAnswer: "(a) 24 cm, (b) 65 litres"
          stepByStepGuideline:
            - "Volume of water from Tank A = 50 × 40 × 30 = 60,000 cm³"
            - "Base area of Tank B = 50 × 50 = 2500 cm²"
            - "(a) Water height = 60000 ÷ 2500 = 24 cm"
            - "Volume of Tank B = 50³ = 125,000 cm³"
            - "(b) Water needed = 125,000 - 60,000 = 65,000 cm³ = 65 litres"

          problemText: "A cuboid-shaped container has a volume of 3600 cm³. The area of its base is 120 cm² and its breadth is 8 cm. Find (a) the height, (b) the length, and (c) the area of the front face."
          finalAnswer: "(a) 30 cm, (b) 15 cm, (c) 450 cm²"
          stepByStepGuideline:
            - "(a) Height = Volume ÷ Base Area = 3600 ÷ 120 = 30 cm"
            - "(b) Length = Base Area ÷ Breadth = 120 ÷ 8 = 15 cm"
            - "(c) Front face area = Length × Height = 15 × 30 = 450 cm²"

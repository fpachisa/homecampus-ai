    - problemText: What does volume measure?
      avatarIntro: Hello! Today we're going to explore a very important idea in mathematics called volume. Let's discover what it means together!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Volume measures the amount of space inside a solid (3D object).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: Think about objects around you like boxes, balls, or cubes."
      - "Step 2: These are all 3D objects (also called solids) - they have length, breadth, and height."
      - "Step 3: Volume tells us how much space is inside these 3D objects."
      - "Step 4: Volume measures the amount of space a solid takes up."

    - problemText: Which of these has volume - a square drawn on paper or a cardboard box?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The cardboard box has volume.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: A square drawn on paper is flat - it only has length and breadth (2D)."
      - "Step 2: A cardboard box has length, breadth, and height (3D)."
      - "Step 3: Only 3D objects (solids) have volume because they take up space."
      - "Step 4: The cardboard box has volume; the square does not."

    - problemText: True or False - A flat circle has volume.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: "False"
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: A flat circle is a 2D shape - it has no height or depth."
      - "Step 2: Volume only applies to 3D objects (solids)."
      - "Step 3: Since a flat circle is not 3D, it does not have volume."
      - "Step 4: The statement is False."

    - problemText: Name two objects in a classroom that have volume.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Examples - a pencil case and a bookshelf (or any two 3D objects)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: Look for objects that are 3D (have length, breadth, and height)."
      - "Step 2: Examples include pencil case, bookshelf, eraser, water bottle, desk."
      - "Step 3: All these objects take up space, so they have volume."
      - "Step 4: Any two 3D classroom objects are correct answers."

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Why can't we measure the volume of a triangle drawn on a whiteboard?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Because a triangle on a whiteboard is a flat 2D shape, not a 3D solid.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: A triangle drawn on a whiteboard is flat."
      - "Step 2: It only has length and breadth - no height or depth."
      - "Step 3: This makes it a 2D shape, not a 3D solid."
      - "Step 4: Volume can only be measured for 3D objects that take up space."

      - "Step 1: Initial water = 72 litres = 72,000 cm³."
      - "Step 2: After storm, water height = $\\frac{3}{4}$ × 50 = 37.5 cm."
      - "Step 3: Final water = 80 × 60 × 37.5 = 180,000 cm³ = 180 litres."
      - "Step 4: Rain collected = 180 - 72 = 108 litres."

    - problemText: A tank 55 cm by 44 cm by 40 cm is $\\frac{1}{4}$ full of water. Water is added until it is $\\frac{3}{4}$ full. Then 15.4 litres is removed. How many litres remain?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 57.2 litres
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: Tank capacity = 55 × 44 × 40 = 96,800 cm³."
      - "Step 2: At $\\frac{3}{4}$ full, water = $\\frac{3}{4}$ × 96,800 = 72,600 cm³ = 72.6 litres."
      - "Step 3: Water removed = 15.4 litres."
      - "Step 4: Remaining = 72.6 - 15.4 = 57.2 litres."

    - problemText: Container A (42 cm by 35 cm by 30 cm) is completely filled with water. The water is poured equally into 3 identical Container Bs. If each Container B is 35 cm by 28 cm and the water reaches exactly to the brim, what is the height of each Container B?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 15 cm
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - "Step 1: Water in A = 42 × 35 × 30 = 44,100 cm³."
      - "Step 2: Water per Container B = 44,100 / 3 = 14,700 cm³."
      - "Step 3: Base area of B = 35 × 28 = 980 cm2."
      - "Step 4: Height of B = 14,700 / 980 = 15 cm."

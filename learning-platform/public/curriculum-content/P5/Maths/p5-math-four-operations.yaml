    - problemText: Calculate 30 / 10
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Today we are looking at how numbers change when we divide them by 10. It is as simple as shifting
        digits one place to the right.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '3'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the number being divided, which is 30.
      - When dividing a number that ends in zero by 10, we shift the digits one place to the right.
      - This is equivalent to removing one zero from the end of the number.
      - Removing the zero from 30 gives us the final result of 3.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Start with the number 230.
      - Division by 10 can be visualized as moving the decimal point one place to the left or shifting digits one place to
        the right.
      - For a whole number ending in zero, simply remove the zero at the end.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The term 'quotient' refers to the result of a division problem.
      - To find the quotient of 4560 divided by 10, look at the last digit of 4560.
      - Since the number ends in zero, dividing by 10 removes that last digit.
      - Shifting the digits of 4560 one place to the right gives 456.

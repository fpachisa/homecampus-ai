      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '0.5'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the denominator of the fraction $\frac{1}{2}$, which is 2.'
      - 'Step 2: Find a number to multiply the denominator by to make it 10. Since $2 \times 5 = 10$, the multiplier is 5.'
      - 'Step 3: Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5 to find the equivalent fraction: $\frac{1 \times 5}{2
        \times 5} = \frac{5}{10}$.'
      - 'Step 4: Convert the fraction $\frac{5}{10}$ to a decimal. 5 tenths is written as 0.5.'

      finalAnswer: '3.25'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Set up the long division by dividing the numerator (13) by the denominator (4).'
      - 'Step 2: Divide 13 by 4. $13 \div 4 = 3$ with a remainder of 1.'
      - 'Step 3: Place a decimal point after the 3 in your quotient and add a decimal point and a zero after 13 to make it
        13.0.'
      - 'Step 4: Bring down the zero to make the remainder 10. Divide 10 by 4. $10 \div 4 = 2$ with a remainder of 2.'
      - 'Step 5: Add another zero to the dividend and bring it down to make the remainder 20. Divide 20 by 4. $20 \div 4 =
        5$ with a remainder of 0.'
      - 'Step 6: The final decimal value is 3.25.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '0.625'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Set up the division $5 \div 8$. Since 5 is less than 8, place a 0 and a decimal point in the quotient.'
      - 'Step 2: Add a zero to the 5 to make it 50. Divide 50 by 8. $50 \div 8 = 6$ with a remainder of 2.'
      - 'Step 3: Add another zero to the remainder to make it 20. Divide 20 by 8. $20 \div 8 = 2$ with a remainder of 4.'
      - 'Step 4: Add one more zero to the remainder to make it 40. Divide 40 by 8. $40 \div 8 = 5$ with a remainder of 0.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '0.375'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Set up the division $3 \div 8$. Because 3 is smaller than 8, the first digit is 0 followed by a decimal point.'
      - 'Step 2: Add a zero to 3 to make it 30. Divide 30 by 8. $30 \div 8 = 3$ with a remainder of 6.'
      - 'Step 3: Add a zero to the remainder to make it 60. Divide 60 by 8. $60 \div 8 = 7$ with a remainder of 4.'

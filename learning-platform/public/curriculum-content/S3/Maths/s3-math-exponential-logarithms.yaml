    - problemText: Determine whether the function $f(x) = 5^x$ is classified as an exponential function. Explain your reasoning
        based on the position of the variable.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start by reviewing the fundamental definition of an exponential function. Remember where
        the variable must be located!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, $f(x) = 5^x$ is an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of an exponential function: $f(x) = a^x$, where $a$ is a constant base and $x$ is the variable
        exponent.'
      - In the function $f(x) = 5^x$, the base is the constant 5, and the variable $x$ is in the exponent.
      - Since the variable is in the exponent, this function matches the definition of an exponential function.

    - problemText: Is the function $g(x) = x^4$ an exponential function? Justify your answer.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, $g(x) = x^4$ is not an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the structure of the function $g(x) = x^4$.
      - In this function, the variable $x$ is the base, and the exponent (4) is a constant number.
      - Functions where the variable is the base and the exponent is a constant are defined as polynomial functions, not exponential
        functions.

    - problemText: Consider the function $h(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$. Is this an exponential function, even though it is multiplied
        by a coefficient?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, $h(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$ is an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the core structure of the function $h(x) = 2 \cdot 3^x$.
      - The defining characteristic of an exponential function is the presence of the variable $x$ in the exponent, acting
        on a constant base (3).
      - Although the function is vertically stretched by the coefficient 2, the variable remains in the exponent, confirming
        that the function is exponential.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Explain why $k(x) = 3x^2 + 5$ cannot be classified as an exponential function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $k(x) = 3x^2 + 5$ is not an exponential function because the variable $x$ is the base, not the exponent.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Compare the structure of $k(x) = 3x^2 + 5$ with the general form of an exponential function $f(x) = a^x$.
      - In $k(x)$, the variable $x$ is the base, and it is raised to a constant power (2). The function also includes other
        polynomial terms and a constant shift.
      - Since the variable is not located in the exponent, $k(x)$ is a polynomial function (specifically, a quadratic function),
        not an exponential function.

    - problemText: Classify the function $m(x) = 0.8^x + 1$. Is it exponential or non-exponential?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It is an exponential function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Examine the primary term of the function, $0.8^x$.
      - The base (0.8) is a constant, and the variable ($x$) is in the exponent.
      - The addition of the constant (+1) represents a vertical shift but does not change the fundamental category of the
        function. Because the variable is in the exponent, $m(x)$ is exponential.

    - problemText: Consider the function $f(x) = 3 \cdot 5^x + 10$. Is this function classified as exponential or non-exponential?
        Provide a detailed explanation focusing on the position of the variable $x$.
      avatarIntro: Identifying functions is key to understanding their behavior. Remember to look closely at where the variable
        is located in relation to the operations.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of an exponential function: the variable must appear in the exponent of a constant base.'
      - In the function $f(x) = 3 \cdot 5^x + 10$, the variable $x$ is the exponent attached to the base 5.
      - The multiplication by 3 (coefficient) and the addition of 10 (vertical shift) do not change the fundamental structure
        where the variable is the exponent.
      - Therefore, $f(x)$ is an exponential function.

    - problemText: Classify the function $g(x) = 2x - 7^3$. Is it exponential or non-exponential? Explain why the term $7^3$
        does not make the function exponential.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Non-Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the terms in the function $g(x) = 2x - 7^3$.
      - The first term, $2x$, is a linear term where the variable $x$ is the base (raised implicitly to the power 1).
      - The second term, $7^3$, is a constant value (since 7 and 3 are both fixed numbers; $7^3 = 343$).
      - Since the variable $x$ is not in the exponent of a constant base anywhere in the expression, the function is non-exponential
        (specifically, it is a linear polynomial). The constant exponential term $7^3$ is irrelevant to the function's classification
        regarding $x$.

    - problemText: Determine whether $h(x) = 0.5^x$ is an exponential function. Justify your answer based on the role of the
        variable.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Examine the structure of $h(x) = 0.5^x$.
      - The base is the constant $0.5$.
      - The variable $x$ occupies the position of the exponent.
      - By definition, any function where a constant base is raised to a power containing the variable is an exponential function.
        Since $x$ is the exponent, $h(x)$ is exponential.

      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: Consider the function $k(x) = 5x^2 + 3^4$. Classify this function as exponential or non-exponential, and
        explain your choice by identifying the base and exponent for the variable term.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Non-Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify where the variable $x$ appears in $k(x) = 5x^2 + 3^4$.
      - The variable appears in the term $5x^2$. Here, $x$ is the base, and the exponent is the constant number 2.
      - The term $3^4$ is a constant value (81) and does not contain the variable $x$.
      - Since the variable $x$ is the base and not in the exponent, the function is a polynomial (quadratic) and is therefore
        non-exponential.
      id: q3-4
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: Is the function $m(x) = x^3$ an exponential function? Explain why or why not, contrasting its structure
        with the required form of an exponential equation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Non-Exponential
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The function $m(x) = x^3$ is a polynomial function (specifically, a cubic function).
      - In this function, the variable $x$ is the base, and the exponent is the constant number 3.
      - For a function to be exponential, the base must be a constant number greater than zero and not equal to one, and the
        exponent must contain the variable.
      - Since the variable is the base, $m(x)$ is non-exponential.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the y-intercept by locating the point where the graph crosses the y-axis. For $f(x) = b^x$, this is always
        (0, 1).
      - Determine the domain by observing the possible x-values the graph covers. Since the graph extends indefinitely horizontally
        in both directions, the domain is all real numbers.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The horizontal asymptote is the line that the graph approaches but never touches as $x$ approaches negative infinity.
        For $f(x) = b^x$, this line is $y=0$.
      - The range consists of all possible y-values. Since the graph lies entirely above the horizontal asymptote $y=0$, the
        range is all positive real numbers, $y > 0$.

      finalAnswer: As $x \to \infty$, $f(x) \to 0$. As $x \to -\infty$, $f(x) \to \infty$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the graph as $x$ moves far to the right ($x \to \infty$). The graph approaches the horizontal asymptote $y=0$,
        so $f(x) \to 0$.
      - Analyze the graph as $x$ moves far to the left ($x \to -\infty$). The graph increases without bound, so $f(x) \to

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The y-intercept is where $x=0$, which is (0, 1).
      - The horizontal asymptote is the line $y=0$.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The range is the set of all output values (y-values). Since the function is always positive, the range is $y > 0$.
      - The domain is the set of all input values (x-values). Since the graph extends infinitely left and right, the domain
        is all real numbers.

          function2Label: g(x)
          showLegend: true
      finalAnswer: $g(x)=10^x$ exhibits a much steeper growth rate. This is because $g(x)$ has a significantly larger base
        (10 > 3). The base determines the multiplication factor for each unit increase in $x$; thus, multiplying by 10 causes
        the output to increase much faster than multiplying by 3.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Observe the graph: $g(x)=10^x$ is visually steeper than $f(x)=3^x$ for $x>0$.'
      - 'Identify the bases: The base of $f(x)$ is 3 and the base of $g(x)$ is 10.'

          showLegend: true
      finalAnswer: $f(x)=0.5^x$ decays faster. For exponential decay functions ($0 < b < 1$), the function with the base closer
        to 0 (and farther from 1) decays more rapidly. Since $0.5$ is closer to 0 than $0.8$, $f(x)$ loses value more quickly.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Observe the graph: $f(x)=0.5^x$ drops below $g(x)=0.8^x$ more quickly as $x$ increases, indicating faster decay.'
      - 'Identify the bases: Bases are 0.5 and 0.8. Both are decay bases ($0 < b < 1$).'
      - 'Determine the rate: Decay is faster when the base is smaller (closer to 0). Since $0.5 < 0.8$, $f(x)$ decays faster

      finalAnswer: $f(x)=2^x$ is exponential growth, and $g(x)=0.5^x$ is exponential decay. This difference is determined
        by the base relative to the number 1. $f(x)$ grows because its base (2) is greater than 1, meaning the quantity increases
        over time. $g(x)$ decays because its base (0.5) is between 0 and 1, meaning the quantity decreases over time.

      finalAnswer: $g(x)=3^x$ is steeper. Since $3 > 2$, $g(x)$ has a larger base. The base represents the multiplication
        factor applied for every unit increase in $x$. Since multiplying by 3 causes a faster rate of increase than multiplying

        corresponds to the function that approaches the horizontal asymptote ($y=0$) faster? Explain why this function decays
        faster.

          showLegend: true
      finalAnswer: The base $0.3$ corresponds to $f(x)$, which approaches the asymptote faster (decays faster). For decay
        functions, the base represents the percentage of the value remaining after each time period (30% remaining vs 70%
        remaining). Since 0.3 is farther from 1, the function decreases more aggressively toward zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Observe the decay curves: $f(x)=0.3^x$ drops faster and stays closer to the x-axis for $x>0$.'
      - 'Identify the bases: Bases are 0.3 and 0.7.'
      - 'Explain the decay speed: Decay is faster when the retention factor (base) is smaller. A base of 0.3 means the function
        is only 30% of its previous value, resulting in a 70% decrease per step. A base of 0.7 results in only a 30% decrease
        per step. Therefore, $f(x)$ decays faster.'

    - problemText: The concentration of a specific drug in a patient's bloodstream decreases by 10% every hour through metabolism.
        Identify the decay factor ($a$) for this process and explain why the factor confirms this relationship is one of exponential
        decay.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! We are exploring exponential decay, where quantities decrease by a constant percentage over time.
        Let's analyze this drug metabolism scenario.
      mathTool:
        toolName: exponentialGraph
        parameters:
          base: 0.9
          coefficient: 1
          showGrid: true
          realWorldContext: true
          showAsymptote: true
      finalAnswer: The decay factor is 0.90. This confirms exponential decay because the factor $a$ is less than 1 but greater
        than 0 ($0 < 0.90 < 1$), meaning the initial quantity is multiplied by a fraction in each time period, causing it
        to decrease steadily towards zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the rate of decrease ($r$). Here, $r = 10\%$, or 0.10.
      - Calculate the decay factor ($a$) using the formula $a = 1 - r$. $a = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.
      - 'State the condition for exponential decay: $0 < a < 1$. Since $0 < 0.90 < 1$, the process is exponential decay.'
      - Explain that a factor between 0 and 1 ensures the quantity decreases but never reaches zero (as illustrated by the
        graph approaching the asymptote $y=0$).

          showGrid: true
          realWorldContext: true
          showAsymptote: true
      finalAnswer: The decay factor $a$ is 0.75. The condition for exponential decay is $0 < a < 1$. Since $0 < 0.75 < 1$,
        this confirms the machinery's value follows an exponential decay model.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the percentage decrease, $r = 25\% = 0.25$.
      - 'Use the alternative form $a = 1 - r$ to find the decay factor: $a = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.'
      - Verify the decay condition. Exponential decay occurs when the base $a$ satisfies $0 < a < 1$.
      - Since $0.75$ falls within this range, the rate represents decay.

      finalAnswer: The decay factor $a$ is 0.70. The condition $0 < a < 1$ signifies that the quantity (current) is multiplied
        by a value less than 1 in each period, causing it to decrease consistently. Since $a > 0$, the quantity remains positive
        and never instantaneously reaches zero (approaching the asymptote $y=0$).

        Convert this expression into its equivalent logarithmic form.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Logarithms are simply a different way to ask about exponents. Let's practice converting between
        these two forms to solidify your understanding.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: \log 100 = 2
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the fundamental definition of the common logarithm: If $10^x = y$, then $\log y = x$. The logarithm asks,
        ''What power (x) must 10 be raised to in order to equal y?'''
      - In the given equation, $10^2 = 100$, the power $x$ is 2, and the result $y$ is 100.
      - 'Substitute these values into the logarithmic form: $\log 100 = 2$. This means the power of 10 that gives 100 is 2.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 10^{-3} = 0.001
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The logarithmic form $\log y = x$ is equivalent to the exponential form $10^x = y$.
      - In $\log 0.001 = -3$, the base is 10, the logarithm result (the exponent, $x$) is -3, and the input value ($y$) is
        0.001.
      - Substituting these parts into the exponential form yields $10^{-3} = 0.001$. This confirms that a negative exponent
        results in a value between 0 and 1.

      finalAnswer: \log 10000 = 4
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The equation $10^4 = 10000$ identifies the power (4) that the base (10) is raised to.
      - The logarithmic form, $\log y = x$, is designed to isolate and define this exponent $x$.
      - Using the values, the equivalent logarithmic statement is $\log 10000 = 4$.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the conversion rule: $\log y = x$ means $10^x = y$.'
      - In the given statement, the base is 10, the exponent ($x$) is 0, and the result ($y$) is 1.
      - Substituting these components into the exponential form gives $10^0 = 1$. This confirms the general rule that any
        non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one.

        How does the logarithmic form reflect the definition of a negative exponent?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: \log 0.1 = -1
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The exponential form $10^{-1} = 0.1$ states that the power -1 applied to base 10 results in 0.1.
      - 'The logarithmic function finds this power (exponent). We use the conversion: If $10^x = y$, then $\log y = x$.'
      - Substituting the values yields $\log 0.1 = -1$. The negative result (-1) in the logarithm indicates that the original
        number (0.1) was obtained by taking the reciprocal of the base raised to a positive power ($1/10^1$).

      - 'If we attempt to evaluate $\log(0)$, we are asking: ''What exponent, $y$, must 10 be raised to in order to equal

          realWorldContext: true
      finalAnswer: Log(-10) is undefined.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The expression $\log(-10)$ requires us to find an exponent $y$ such that $10^y = -10$.
      - If 10 is raised to a positive power (e.g., $10^2 = 100$), the result is positive.
      - If 10 is raised to a negative power (e.g., $10^{-2} = 0.01$), the result is positive.
      - If 10 is raised to the power of zero ($10^0 = 1$), the result is positive.
      - Since 10 raised to any real power is always positive, it can never equal a negative number like -10. Thus, negative
        numbers are not allowed in the domain of the logarithm.

      finalAnswer: 'Domain: $x > 0$.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The domain of a function consists of all permissible input values, $x$.
      - For the logarithm function $f(x) = \log x$, the argument $x$ must be strictly greater than zero ($x > 0$).
      - This is because the inverse exponential function, $10^y = x$, only produces positive results for $x$.

      finalAnswer: 'Range: All real numbers, or $(-\infty, \infty)$.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The range of a function refers to all possible output values, $y$.
      - The logarithmic function $y = \log x$ is the inverse of the exponential function $x = 10^y$.
      - Since the base (10) is positive, we can raise it to any real number $y$. If $y$ is a very large positive number, $x$
        is very large. If $y$ is a very large negative number, $x$ is very close to zero.
      - Because the inputs of the exponential function ($y$) cover all real numbers, the outputs (range) of the inverse logarithmic
        function must also cover all real numbers.
      - Graphically, the curve extends infinitely high and infinitely low, covering all possible y-values.

          realWorldContext: true
      finalAnswer: The vertical asymptote is located at $x = 0$ (the y-axis).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - A vertical asymptote exists where the function approaches positive or negative infinity.
      - For $f(x) = \log x$, as $x$ approaches 0 from the right side (e.g., $x=0.0001$), the value of the function decreases
        rapidly towards $-\infty$.
      - Therefore, the line $x = 0$ (the y-axis) is the vertical asymptote.
      - The vertical asymptote $x=0$ marks the boundary of the domain. Since the function is only defined for $x > 0$, the
        graph cannot exist on or to the left of this vertical line.

      avatarIntro: Solving exponential equations can be tricky when the bases don't match. Let's explore how logarithms unlock
        these variables.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Logarithms must be used because 19 cannot be written as a simple integer power of 3 ($3^2=9$ and $3^3=27$).
        Since the variable $x$ is in the exponent, the only way to isolate it algebraically is by applying the Power Law of

        like this, and what characteristic of the numbers (0.5 and 0.15) prevents its use here.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The same-base method fails when the two sides of the equation ($0.5$ and $0.15$) cannot be easily expressed
        as powers of a common base, particularly when the resulting exponent would be non-integer. For $0.5^t = 0.15$, $0.15$
        is not a recognizable integer or simple rational power of $0.5$. If we tried to write $0.15 = 0.5^k$, $k$ would be

        finalAnswer: x-intercept is (-2.75,0), y-intercept is (0, 3.58)
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "To find the x-intercept, set $f(x)=0$: $0 = \\log_2(x+3)+2$."
          - "Isolate the logarithm: $\\log_2(x+3) = -2$."

          - "Add the constant: $f(0) \\approx 1.58496 + 2 = 3.58496$. Rounding to two decimal places, the y-intercept is $(0, 3.58)$."

        finalAnswer: "{y | -1.32 \\leq y \\leq 5.70}"
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Identify the given domain for $f(x)$: $-2.9 \\leq x \\leq 10$."
          - Recognize that $f(x) = \log_2(x+3)+2$ is an increasing function because the base of the logarithm (2) is greater than 1. This means the minimum value of $f(x)$ will occur at the minimum x-value in the domain, and the maximum value will occur at the maximum x-value.
          - "Calculate the minimum value of $f(x)$ at $x=-2.9$: $f(-2.9) = \\log_2(-2.9+3)+2 = \\log_2(0.1)+2$."
          - Compute $\log_2(0.1) = \frac{\ln(0.1)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-2.302585}{0.693147} \approx -3.3219$. So, $f(-2.9) \approx -3.3219 + 2 = -1.3219$.
          - "Calculate the maximum value of $f(x)$ at $x=10$: $f(10) = \\log_2(10+3)+2 = \\log_2(13)+2$."
          - Compute $\log_2(13) = \frac{\ln(13)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{2.564949}{0.693147} \approx 3.7004$. So, $f(10) \approx 3.7004 + 2 = 5.7004$.

        finalAnswer: k=4
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Start with the given function: $f(x) = \\log_2(x+3)+2$."
          - The goal is to express $f(x)$ as a single logarithm of base 2. To do this, we need to express the constant '2' as a logarithm of base 2.
          - "Use the property $c = \\log_b(b^c)$: So, $2 = \\log_2(2^2)$."
          - "Calculate $2^2$: $2 = \\log_2(4)$."
          - "Substitute this back into the function: $f(x) = \\log_2(x+3) + \\log_2(4)$."
          - "Apply the logarithm property $\\log_b A + \\log_b B = \\log_b (AB)$ to combine the two logarithmic terms: $f(x) = \\log_2(4(x+3))$."
          - Compare this to the desired form $\log_2 k(x+3)$. By direct comparison, we can see that $k=4$.
          - Therefore, the constant $k$ is 4.

        avatarIntro: Let's find out how many years it takes for the wolf population to reach 50. We'll use the given exponential model for the wolf population.
        finalAnswer: $x = \log_2 \frac{5}{3}$
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - Start by setting the given population model for wolves, $W = 30(2^x)$, equal to the target population of 50.
          - "Divide both sides of the equation by 30 to isolate the exponential term $2^x$: $\\frac{50}{30} = 2^x$, which simplifies to $\\frac{5}{3} = 2^x$."
          - To solve for x, apply the definition of a logarithm. If $b^y = c$, then $y = \log_b c$. In this case, $b=2$, $y=x$, and $c=\frac{5}{3}$.
          - Therefore, $x = \log_2 \frac{5}{3}$. This is the exact value of x.
          - Using a calculator, $x \approx \frac{\ln(5/3)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.5108}{0.6931} \approx 0.737$ years (3 s.f.).

        finalAnswer: ln 1.7 or 0.531
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - Use the rabbit population model $R = 20e^{Bx}$ and the given condition that $R=34$ when $x=1$.
          - "Substitute these values into the equation: $34 = 20e^{B \\times 1}$."
          - "Divide both sides by 20 to isolate the exponential term: $\\frac{34}{20} = e^B$, which simplifies to $1.7 = e^B$."
          - "To solve for B, take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides: $\\ln(1.7) = \\ln(e^B)$."

        finalAnswer: x = -2.49 (3 s.f.) (answer-INCORRECT, given x = 1.35)
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Set the population equations for rabbits ($R = 20e^{Bx}$) and wolves ($W = 30(2^x)$) equal to each other: $20e^{Bx} = 30(2^x)$."
          - Substitute the value of $B = \ln(1.7)$ from part (b-ii) into the rabbit equation. Recall that $e^{(\ln 1.7)x} = (e^{\ln 1.7})^x = (1.7)^x$. So the equation becomes $20(1.7)^x = 30(2^x)$.
          - "Rearrange the equation to group terms with x: $\\frac{(1.7)^x}{2^x} = \\frac{30}{20}$. This simplifies to $(\\frac{1.7}{2})^x = 1.5$."

        finalAnswer: Rabbits do not exceed wolves for $x \ge 0$ (answer-INCORRECT, given x = 1.35 years)
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - From part (d), we compared the growth of $W(x) = 30(2^x)$ and $R(x) = 20(1.7)^x$.
          - At $x=0$, the initial populations are $W(0) = 30$ and $R(0) = 20$. So, $W(0) > R(0)$.
          - The growth rate of wolves (base 2) is greater than the growth rate of rabbits (base 1.7). This means $2^x$ grows faster than $1.7^x$ for $x > 0$.
          - Since the wolf population starts higher and grows faster, the rabbit population will never catch up to or exceed the wolf population for any $x \ge 0$.
          - Therefore, based on the given population models, the population of rabbits will not exceed the population of wolves at any point in the future. The provided answer of '1.35 years' is not consistent with these models.

        avatarIntro: Let's start by confirming the initial temperature of the water. This means looking at the temperature when no time has passed after removing the pot.
        finalAnswer: 90°C
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - The phrase 'when the pot has just been removed from the cooker' indicates that the time $m$ is 0 minutes.
          - "Substitute $m=0$ into the given temperature equation: $T(0) = 80(2.64)^{-0.3 \\times 0} + 10$."

          - In general, to solve an equation where two functions are set equal, you would substitute the expressions for $S(m)$ and $T(m)$ into the equation.
          - The equation would then be rearranged to a form that can be solved algebraically, graphically, or numerically. For exponential equations, this often involves taking logarithms.
          - For example, if $S(m)$ were another exponential function, one might isolate the exponential terms and then use logarithms. If it were a polynomial or a linear function, a graphical method or numerical solver (like on a graphing calculator) would typically be required for transcendental equations.
          - Without the specific expression for $S(m)$, we cannot perform the exact calculations. However, if such an equation were solved, the process would yield the time(s) 'm' where the two temperatures are equal.
          - Given the answer $m = 3.45$ minutes, this value represents the time at which the temperature of the 'soup' (assuming S(m) refers to a soup) and the water are identical.

        finalAnswer: It represents the time taken (in mins) for the soup and the water to reach the same temperature.

          - Assuming $S(m)$ represents the temperature of a 'soup' or another substance (implied by the context of similar problems), then $S(m) = T(m)$ means that the temperature of this other substance is equal to the temperature of the water.
          - The solution $m = 3.45$ minutes from part (f) is the specific time (in minutes) when these two temperatures become equal.

          - "Rewrite the equation using natural logarithm notation: $3x-2 = 2\\ln(2.7x)$."
          - This is a transcendental equation, meaning it cannot be solved algebraically for x using elementary functions. It requires numerical methods or a graphing calculator.
          - "To solve graphically, we can define two functions: $y_1 = 3x-2$ and $y_2 = 2\\ln(2.7x)$. The solutions for x are the x-coordinates of the intersection points of these two graphs."
          - Alternatively, rearrange the equation to $f(x) = 3x-2 - 2\ln(2.7x) = 0$ and find the roots of this function using a numerical solver (e.g., Newton-Raphson method) or by graphing $f(x)$ and finding where it crosses the x-axis.

        finalAnswer: $y = (x-1)^2-2$
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Apply the power rule of logarithms, $k \\log_b M = \\log_b M^k$, to the first term: $2\\log_3 (x-1) = \\log_3 (x-1)^2$."
          - The equation becomes $\log_3 (x-1)^2 - \log_3 (y+2) = 2$.
          - "Apply the quotient rule of logarithms, $\\log_b M - \\log_b N = \\log_b \\left(\\frac{M}{N}\\right)$: $\\log_3 \\left(\\frac{(x-1)^2}{y+2}\\right) = 2$."
          - Convert the logarithmic equation into its equivalent exponential form. If $\log_b M = k$, then $b^k = M$. Here, $b=3$, $k=2$, and $M=\frac{(x-1)^2}{y+2}$.
          - So, $3^2 = \frac{(x-1)^2}{y+2}$, which simplifies to $9 = \frac{(x-1)^2}{y+2}$.

This implies that the step $3^2$ was not used. Instead, it was $3^2=9$. The provided answer $y = (x-1)^2-2$ means that the $3^2$ was not simplified. Let's re-evaluate the question with the strict assumption that $3^2 = 9$. My answer is $y = \\frac{(x-1)^2}{9}-2$. This means the provided answer is INCORRECT."

        finalAnswer: $5^{8x+2}$
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - The goal is to express both terms with a base of 5. The first term, $5^{5x+2}$, is already in this form.
          - "Express 125 as a power of 5: $125 = 5^3$."
          - "Substitute this into the second term: $125^x = (5^3)^x$."
          - "Apply the exponent rule $(b^m)^n = b^{mn}$: $(5^3)^x = 5^{3x}$."
          - "Now substitute this back into the original expression: $5^{5x+2} \\times 5^{3x}$."
          - "Apply the exponent rule $b^m \\times b^n = b^{m+n}$: $5^{5x+2} \\times 5^{3x} = 5^{(5x+2) + 3x}$."
          - "Combine the terms in the exponent: $5x + 3x + 2 = 8x + 2$."

        finalAnswer: $x = -\frac{3}{16}$
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - From part (a), we simplified the left side of the equation to $5^{8x+2}$. So the equation becomes $5^{8x+2} = \sqrt{5}$.
          - Express the right side, $\sqrt{5}$, as a power of 5. Recall that $\sqrt{b} = b^{1/2}$.
          - So, $\sqrt{5} = 5^{1/2}$.
          - Now the equation is $5^{8x+2} = 5^{1/2}$.
          - "Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: $8x+2 = \\frac{1}{2}$."
          - "To solve for x, first subtract 2 from both sides: $8x = \\frac{1}{2} - 2$."
          - Calculate $\frac{1}{2} - 2 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}$. So, $8x = -\frac{3}{2}$.

Give your answer to the nearest month.
        finalAnswer: Impossible with given model (answer-INCORRECT)
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - The given population model is $P(t) = 30\times (1.2)^{t/10} + 10$.
          - From part (a-i), we found the initial population at $t=0$ is $P(0)=40$.
          - The base of the exponential term is $1.2$. Since $1.2 > 1$, the term $(1.2)^{t/10}$ represents exponential growth. This means as time $t$ increases, the population $P(t)$ will increase.
          - The function $P(t)$ will always be greater than or equal to its initial value, 40 (for $t \ge 0$). In fact, the term $30\times (1.2)^{t/10}$ will always be positive and increasing from 30 (at $t=0$).
          - Therefore, $P(t)$ will always be greater than or equal to $30 \times 1 + 10 = 40$.
          - A population of 15 fishes is less than the initial population of 40 fishes. Since the model describes population growth (or at least constant at $t=0$), it is impossible for the population to decrease to 15 fishes. The model itself predicts increasing values for $t>0$.
          - The problem statement for this part conflicts with the provided population model.
          - The calculated answer is impossible with the given model, which does not match the provided answer of 10. Therefore, the provided answer is incorrect.

        finalAnswer: 0.571 (3sf)
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - A zero of a function $f(x)$ is an x-value for which $f(x) = 0$.
          - "Set the given function equal to zero: $\\frac{4-7x}{e^x} = 0$."
          - For a fraction to be zero, its numerator must be zero, provided the denominator is non-zero. The denominator $e^x$ is never zero for any real x.
          - "Therefore, we set the numerator to zero: $4 - 7x = 0$."
          - "Solve for x: $7x = 4$, which gives $x = \\frac{4}{7}$."
          - "Convert the fraction to a decimal and round to three significant figures: $x \\approx 0.57142... \\approx 0.571$."
          - The zero of $f(x)$ is approximately $0.571$.
          - The calculated answer $0.571$ does not match the provided answer of $0.759$. Therefore, the provided answer is incorrect.

        finalAnswer: A(1.57, -1.45) (answer-INCORRECT)
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - To find the minimum point, we need to find the first derivative of $f(x)$ and set it to zero. The function is $f(x) = \frac{4-7x}{e^x}$.
          - "Use the quotient rule for differentiation: $f'(x) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, where $u = 4-7x$ and $v = e^x$."
          - Calculate $u' = -7$ and $v' = e^x$.
          - "Substitute these into the quotient rule: $f'(x) = \\frac{(-7)e^x - (4-7x)e^x}{(e^x)^2}$."
          - "Factor out $e^x$ from the numerator: $f'(x) = \\frac{e^x [-7 - (4-7x)]}{(e^x)^2} = \\frac{-7 - 4 + 7x}{e^x} = \\frac{7x - 11}{e^x}$."
          - "Set $f'(x) = 0$ to find the critical points: $\\frac{7x - 11}{e^x} = 0$."
          - "Since $e^x$ is never zero, the numerator must be zero: $7x - 11 = 0$."
          - "Solve for x: $7x = 11$, so $x = \\frac{11}{7}$. This is the x-coordinate of the critical point."
          - "To find the y-coordinate, substitute $x = \\frac{11}{7}$ back into the original function $f(x)$: $f\\left(\\frac{11}{7}\\right) = \\frac{4-7\\left(\\frac{11}{7}\\right)}{e^{11/7}} = \\frac{4-11}{e^{11/7}} = \\frac{-7}{e^{11/7}}$."
          - "Calculate the numerical values: $x \\approx 1.571$ (3sf) and $f(11/7) \\approx \\frac{-7}{e^{1.5714}} \\approx \\frac{-7}{4.813} \\approx -1.454$ (3sf)."
          - Thus, the coordinates of point A are approximately $(1.57, -1.45)$. We can confirm this is a minimum by checking the second derivative, $f''(x) = \frac{18-7x}{e^x}$, and $f''(11/7) = \frac{18-7(11/7)}{e^{11/7}} = \frac{7}{e^{11/7}} > 0$, indicating a minimum.
          - The calculated coordinates for A are (1.57, -1.45), which do not match the provided answer A(2.25, -3.31). Therefore, the provided answer is incorrect.

        problemText: Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+2}}$.<br><br>(a-i) Find the domain of f;
        avatarIntro: Let's start by finding the domain of our function f(x). Remember, the expression under a square root must be non-negative, and the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero.
        finalAnswer: x>-2
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Identify the structure of the function: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+2}}$. It contains a square root in the denominator."
          - "Recall the domain rules: For a real-valued function, the expression inside a square root must be greater than or equal to zero. Also, the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero."
          - "Apply the first rule: The expression under the square root, $x+2$, must be non-negative, so $x+2 \\ge 0$."
          - "Apply the second rule: Since $\\sqrt{x+2}$ is in the denominator, it cannot be zero. This means $x+2 \\ne 0$."
          - "Combine the conditions: $x+2 \\ge 0$ and $x+2 \\ne 0$ simplifies to $x+2 > 0$."
          - "Solve for x: Subtract 2 from both sides of the inequality, giving $x > -2$."
          - "State the domain: The domain of f is all real numbers $x$ such that $x > -2$."

        problemText: Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+2}}$.<br><br>(a-ii) Find the range of f.
        finalAnswer: f(x)>0
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Start with the domain found in part (a-i): $x > -2$."
          - "Analyze the term inside the square root: Since $x > -2$, it implies $x+2 > 0$."
          - "Consider the square root: If $x+2 > 0$, then $\\sqrt{x+2}$ will always be a positive real number."
          - "Examine the behavior of $\\sqrt{x+2}$: As $x$ approaches $-2$ from the right, $x+2$ approaches $0^+$, so $\\sqrt{x+2}$ approaches $0^+$. As $x$ increases, $\\sqrt{x+2}$ increases without bound, approaching $\\infty$."
          - "Now consider the reciprocal: $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+2}}$. As $\\sqrt{x+2}$ approaches $0^+$, $f(x)$ approaches $\\infty$. As $\\sqrt{x+2}$ approaches $\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $0^+$."
          - Since the denominator $\sqrt{x+2}$ is always positive, the fraction $f(x)$ will also always be positive.
          - "State the range: The range of f is all real numbers $f(x)$ such that $f(x) > 0$."

        problemText: Let $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+2}}$.<br><br>(b-i) Let $g(x) = 2-\ln(x^2-1)$. Solve f(x) = g(x).
        finalAnswer: x=-1.59, x = 2.36
        stepByStepGuideline:
          - "Set up the equation: We need to solve $f(x) = g(x)$, which means $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+2}} = 2-\\ln(x^2-1)$."
          - "Determine the domain of $g(x)$: For $\\ln(x^2-1)$ to be defined, the argument must be positive, so $x^2-1 > 0$. This factors as $(x-1)(x+1) > 0$, implying $x < -1$ or $x > 1$."
          - "Find the combined domain for the equation: We need $x > -2$ (from $f(x)$'s domain) AND ($x < -1$ or $x > 1$). This results in two valid intervals: $(-2, -1) \\cup (1, \\infty)$. Any solutions must fall within these intervals."
          - "Recognize the type of equation: This is a transcendental equation involving both a square root and a logarithm. Such equations typically do not have exact algebraic solutions and require numerical or graphical methods."
          - "Use a numerical solver or graphing calculator: Plot both $y_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x+2}}$ and $y_2 = 2-\\ln(x^2-1)$ and find their points of intersection within the combined domain."
          - "Approximate the solutions: By examining the graph or using a numerical solver, we find two approximate intersection points. For $x \\approx -1.59$: $f(-1.59) \\approx 1.56$, $g(-1.59) \\approx 1.58$. For $x \\approx 2.36$: $f(2.36) \\approx 0.479$, $g(2.36) \\approx 0.481$. These values are within the acceptable domain."
          - "State the final approximate solutions: The solutions, rounded to two decimal places as implied by the given answer, are $x = -1.59$ and $x = 2.36$."

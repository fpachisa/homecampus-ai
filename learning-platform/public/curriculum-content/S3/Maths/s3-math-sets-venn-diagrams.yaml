    - problemText: 'Let $A$ be the set defined as $A = \{x: x \text{ is a factor of } 60\}$. List all the elements of set
        $A$.'
      avatarIntro: Hello! Let's start by reviewing how to identify all the factors of a given number. This will help us list
        the elements of set A correctly.
      finalAnswer: '{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60}'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define a factor: A number that divides 60 exactly without leaving a remainder.'
      - 'Systematically find all pairs of numbers whose product is 60: (1, 60), (2, 30), (3, 20), (4, 15), (5, 12), and (6,
        10).'
      - List all the unique factors found in ascending order.
      - The elements of set A are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60}.

    - problemText: Let $B$ be the set of positive integers that are multiples of 4 and less than 80. Find $n(B)$, the cardinality
        (number of elements) of set $B$.
      finalAnswer: '19'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the definition of set $B$: Multiples of 4, starting from $4 \times 1$, up to the largest multiple less than
        80.'
      - The elements are $4, 8, 12, \dots$
      - 'Find how many times 4 goes into 80: $80 \div 4 = 20$. This means 80 is the 20th multiple of 4.'
      - Since the condition is 'less than 80', 80 itself is excluded.
      - The set B contains multiples $4 \times 1$ through $4 \times 19$. Therefore, $n(B) = 19$.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of a prime number: a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than
        1 and itself.'
      - 'List the prime numbers less than 30: $P = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\}$.'
      - The statement $17 \in P$ means '17 is an element of set P'.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the required integers: numbers strictly between 10 and 25, which are {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
        20, 21, 22, 23, 24}.'

      - 'Identify composite numbers (numbers that have factors other than 1 and itself): These are the remaining integers.'

        A) Find the cardinality, $n(S)$.

        B) Determine if the statement $130 \notin S$ is True or False.'
      finalAnswer: A) 12; B) True
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Part A: List the positive perfect squares until the square exceeds 150.'
      - The squares are $1^2=1, 2^2=4, \dots, 12^2=144$. Since $13^2=169$, it is excluded.
      - The elements of $S$ are the squares of integers 1 through 12. Thus, $n(S) = 12$.
      - 'Part B: Determine if 130 is a perfect square.'
      - Since $11^2 = 121$ and $12^2 = 144$, 130 falls between two perfect squares and is not a perfect square itself.
      - The notation $130 \notin S$ means '130 is not an element of S'. Since 130 is not a perfect square, it is not in $S$.
        The statement is True.

      finalAnswer: 'Yes'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - To determine if A ⊆ B, we must check if every element in Set A is also present in Set B.
      - 'Set A contains elements: 10, 20, 30.'
      - 'Set B contains elements: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.'
      - Since 10 ∈ B, 20 ∈ B, and 30 ∈ B, all elements of A are in B. Therefore, A is a subset of B.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - For P to be a subset of Q, every element in P must also be in Q.
      - P = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.
      - Q = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.
      - We check elements in P. The element 2 is in P, but 2 is not in Q. (Similarly, 4, 6, 12 are not in Q).
      - Since there is at least one element in P (like 2) that is not in Q, P is not a subset of Q (P ⊄ Q).

      - First, determine the elements of Set C by listing the distinct letters in 'SUCCESS'. C = {S, U, C, E}.
      - Set D is given as D = {S, U, C, E}.
      - Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. The order in which elements are listed does not matter.
      - Since C and D contain the exact same elements, C = D.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The empty set (∅) is the set containing no elements.
      - A fundamental rule of set theory states that the empty set is a subset of every set.
      - Even though R = {53, 59} (or any other set), the condition for S ⊆ R is always met when S = ∅.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the prime factors of 30: 30 = 2 × 3 × 5. So, P = {2, 3, 5}.'

      avatarIntro: Drawing Venn diagrams helps us visualize relationships between sets. Let's start by finding the common
        elements.

      - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

      - Observe that the entire area covered by circle A and the entire area covered by circle B is shaded.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'True'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the definition of the complement of a set, A'. A' contains all elements in U that are not in A.
      - The union $A \cup A'$ includes all elements that are either in A or in A'.
      - Since every element in the universal set U must be either in A or not in A (i.e., in A'), the union $A \cup A'$ must
        equal U. This is the Complement Law.

      - The intersection of two sets contains only the elements common to both sets.
      - The empty set $\emptyset$ contains no elements.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The universal set U contains all possible elements under consideration.
      - The intersection $A \cap U$ includes all elements common to both A and U.
      - Since A is defined within U, every element in A is also in U. Thus, the common elements are exactly the elements of
        A. This is the Identity Law for Intersection.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The Idempotent Law states that the union of a set with itself results in the set itself.
      - If an element is in A, it is also in $A \cup A$. If an element is in $A \cup A$, it must be in A.
      - Therefore, $A \cup A = A$. It is only equal to U if A itself happens to be the universal set U.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - This identity is known as De Morgan's second law.
      - 'To verify, consider the region for $(P \cap Q)''$: this is everything outside the intersection of P and Q.'

        Q. The union of these complements includes every element that is not simultaneously in both P and Q.'
      - Since both expressions describe the exact same region (the entire universal set U minus the intersection $P \cap Q$),
        the identity is always true.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - This identity represents the property that Union distributes over Intersection.
      - The formula states that taking the union of A with the intersection of B and C yields the same result as taking the
        intersection of (A union B) and (A union C).
      - This is a fundamental distributive law in Set Theory, and it is always true.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The correct Distributive Law for intersection over union is $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$.
      - The given statement incorrectly uses intersection ($\cap$) instead of union ($\cup$) on the right-hand side.
      - 'Consider a counterexample: Let A = {1, 2}, B = {2, 3}, C = {4}.'
      - 'LHS: $A \cap (B \cup C) = \{1, 2\} \cap \{2, 3, 4\} = \{2\}$.'
      - 'RHS: $(A \cap B) \cap (A \cap C)$. $A \cap B = \{2\}$. $A \cap C = \emptyset$. $(A \cap B) \cap (A \cap C) = \{2\}
        \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$.'
      - Since LHS $\neq$ RHS, the statement is False.

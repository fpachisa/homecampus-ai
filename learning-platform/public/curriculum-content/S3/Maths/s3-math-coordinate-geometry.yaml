    - problemText: From the grid shown, determine the coordinates of point T.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start by practicing how to read coordinates accurately from the Cartesian plane. Remember
        to always list the x-coordinate first.
      mathTool:
        toolName: cartesianPlane
        parameters:
          xMin: -10
          xMax: 10
          yMin: -10
          yMax: 10
          showGrid: true
          points:
          - label: T
            x: -8
            y: -3
      finalAnswer: (-8, -3)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the horizontal position (x-coordinate) of point T. Starting from the origin (0, 0), move left 8 units. So,
        x = -8.
      - Identify the vertical position (y-coordinate) of point T. From x = -8, move down 3 units. So, y = -3.
      - 'Write the coordinates as an ordered pair (x, y): (-8, -3). Since both coordinates are negative, the point is in Quadrant
        III.'

      finalAnswer: Quadrant II
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze the signs of the coordinates: Point R is (-4, 5).'
      - The x-coordinate is negative (x < 0). This means the point is to the left of the y-axis.
      - The y-coordinate is positive (y > 0). This means the point is above the x-axis.
      - The region where x is negative and y is positive is Quadrant II.

        pair (x, y) for point K and identify which quadrant it is in.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (3, -2). Quadrant IV.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the x-coordinate: 3 units to the right of the y-axis means x = +3.'
      - 'Determine the y-coordinate: 2 units below the x-axis means y = -2.'
      - The ordered pair is (3, -2).
      - Since x is positive and y is negative, the point K is located in Quadrant IV.

            y: 9
      finalAnswer: '9'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall that coordinates are written in the order (x, y).
      - For point Q(6, 9), the first value, 6, is the x-coordinate (horizontal position).
      - The second value, 9, is the y-coordinate (vertical position).
      - The value of the y-coordinate for point Q is 9.

        Horizontal and vertical lines always intersect at a 90° angle.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the characteristics of Line H ($y=3$). This is a horizontal line, meaning its gradient $m_H = 0$.
      - Determine the characteristics of Line V ($x=-2$). This is a vertical line, meaning its gradient $m_V$ is undefined.
      - 'Recall the geometric definition of perpendicularity: lines meeting at a 90° angle.'
      - Since horizontal lines are perfectly level and vertical lines are perfectly upright, they always meet at a right angle
        (90°).
      - Therefore, the lines are perpendicular, even though the algebraic product rule $m_1 \times m_2 = -1$ cannot be applied
        due to the undefined gradient.

      finalAnswer: The perpendicular bisector is a line that 1) passes through the midpoint of the segment [AB] and 2) is
        perpendicular (forms a 90° angle) to the segment [AB].
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the two components implied by the name 'perpendicular bisector'.
      - The term 'bisector' means the line divides the segment into two equal halves, thus passing through the midpoint.
      - The term 'perpendicular' means the line forms a right angle (90°) with the segment.
      - Combine these two properties for the full definition.

      finalAnswer: PA = √10 and PB = √10. Since PA = PB, the point P(4, 0) lies on the perpendicular bisector of [AB].
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Use the distance formula $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$ to calculate PA.
      - 'PA: $\sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (0 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 1} = \sqrt{10}$.'
      - Use the distance formula to calculate PB.
      - 'PB: $\sqrt{(4 - 5)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10}$.'
      - Compare the distances. Since PA = PB, the point P satisfies the equidistance property and therefore lies on the perpendicular
        bisector.

      finalAnswer: Point P lies on the perpendicular bisector. PA = √18 and PB = √18. Point Q does not lie on the bisector
        as QA = √26 and QB = √2.
      stepByStepGuideline:

      - Calculate PB = $\sqrt{(1 - 4)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{18}$.

      finalAnswer: The perpendicular bisector represents the locus of all points equidistant from Station A and Station B.
        This line acts as the boundary. Any point on the side of the bisector containing Station A (the proximity region of
        A) is strictly closer to A than to B, thus ensuring the guaranteed closer service from Station A.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the purpose of the boundary: It must separate the regions based on minimum distance.'
      - 'Recall the equidistance property: Points on the perpendicular bisector are equally far from A and B.'
      - If a point moves slightly off the bisector toward A, its distance to A becomes smaller than its distance to B.
      - 'Therefore, the perpendicular bisector defines the exact boundary line, dividing the plane into two proximity regions:
        one where all points are closer to A, and one where all points are closer to B.'

      avatarIntro: Welcome! Proving triangle properties using coordinate geometry requires careful calculation of distances
        or gradients. Let's start by calculating all three side lengths.

      finalAnswer: The lengths are AB = 6, AC = 5, and BC = 5. Since AC = BC, triangle ABC is isosceles.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the length of side AB using the distance formula: $d_{AB} = \sqrt{(6-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = \sqrt{36} = 6$.'

            - 2
            label: F
      finalAnswer: The gradient of DE is 1/2 and the gradient of EF is -2. Since $m_{DE} \times m_{EF} = (1/2) \times (-2)
        = -1$, the sides DE and EF are perpendicular, meaning triangle DEF is right-angled at E.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side DE: $m_{DE} = (6-4)/(5-1) = 2/4 = 1/2$.'
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side EF: $m_{EF} = (2-6)/(7-5) = -4/2 = -2$.'
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side DF: $m_{DF} = (2-4)/(7-1) = -2/6 = -1/3$. (Optional step, but good practice)'
      - Check if any two gradients multiply to -1. $m_{DE} \times m_{EF} = (1/2) \times (-2) = -1$.
      - Since the product of the gradients of DE and EF is -1, the angle at E is $90^\circ$. Conclude that triangle DEF is
        right-angled.

      finalAnswer: The lengths are PQ = 4, PR = 4, and QR = 4. Since all three sides are equal, triangle PQR is equilateral.
      stepByStepGuideline:

      finalAnswer: $JK^2 = 13$, $KL^2 = 13$, and $LJ^2 = 26$. Since $JK^2 + KL^2 = 13 + 13 = 26 = LJ^2$, the triangle JKL

      finalAnswer: The quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram because opposite sides AB and DC have a gradient of 1/2, and
        opposite sides BC and AD have a gradient of -3. Since both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the figure is a parallelogram.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side AB: m_AB = (3 - 1) / (5 - 1) = 2/4 = 1/2.'
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side DC: m_DC = (0 - (-2)) / (6 - 2) = 2/4 = 1/2.'
      - Since m_AB = m_DC, the sides AB and DC are parallel.
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side BC: m_BC = (0 - 3) / (6 - 5) = -3/1 = -3.'
      - 'Calculate the gradient of side AD: m_AD = (-2 - 1) / (2 - 1) = -3/1 = -3.'
      - Since m_BC = m_AD, the sides BC and AD are parallel. As both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, ABCD is a parallelogram.

      finalAnswer: The quadrilateral PQRS is a rhombus because the lengths of all four sides are equal (PQ = QR = RS = SP
        = 5 units).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Use the distance formula to calculate the length of side PQ: PQ = sqrt[(4-0)² + (3-0)²] = sqrt[16 + 9] = 5.'
      - 'Calculate the length of side QR: QR = sqrt[(8-4)² + (0-3)²] = sqrt[16 + 9] = 5.'

      - 'Calculate the length of side SP: SP = sqrt[(0-4)² + (0-(-3))²] = sqrt[16 + 9] = 5.'
      - Since all four side lengths (PQ, QR, RS, SP) are equal, PQRS is a rhombus.

      finalAnswer: EFGH is a rectangle. Opposite sides EF and HG are parallel (m=1/3), and FG and EH are parallel (m=-3),
        confirming it is a parallelogram. Since the adjacent sides EF and FG have gradients (1/3) and (-3), their product
        is -1, meaning they are perpendicular (90°).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the gradients of the four sides: m_EF = 1/3, m_HG = 1/3; m_FG = -3, m_EH = -3.'
      - Confirm EFGH is a parallelogram because opposite sides have equal gradients (EF || HG and FG || EH).
      - Check for perpendicularity between adjacent sides EF and FG.
      - 'Multiply the adjacent gradients: m_EF × m_FG = (1/3) × (-3) = -1.'
      - Since the product of the gradients of two adjacent sides is -1, the angle ∠EFG is 90°. A parallelogram with a right
        angle is a rectangle.

    - problemText: A robot is navigating a simulated 3D environment defined by a cube with side length 5, starting at the
        origin. The robot must move to the specific vertex that lies on the YZ coordinate plane (where X=0) and has the maximum
        possible Z-coordinate. What are the coordinates of this target vertex?
      mathTool:
        toolName: coordinate3DPlane
        parameters:
          length: 5

          customPoints:
          - 0,5,5
      finalAnswer: (0, 5, 5)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the constraints: The cube has side length 5, so coordinates are combinations of 0 and 5.'
      - The vertex must lie on the YZ plane. This means the X-coordinate must be 0.
      - The vertex must have the maximum possible Z-coordinate, which is Z=5.
      - The remaining Y-coordinate must also be a dimension extreme (0 or 5). Choosing Y=5 ensures it is a vertex and maximizes
        the distance from the XZ plane.
      - Combining these requirements gives the coordinates (X, Y, Z) = (0, 5, 5).

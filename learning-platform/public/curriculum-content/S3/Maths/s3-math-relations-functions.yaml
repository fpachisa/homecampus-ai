    - problemText: Is the set of ordered pairs {(1, 5), (2, 8), (3, 11), (4, 14)} a relation?
      avatarIntro: A relation is simply a connection between two sets of data, usually represented by x and y. Let's practice
        identifying them.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, this set is a relation.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the definition of a relation in mathematics.
      - A relation is any set of ordered pairs (x, y) that connects elements from one set (x) to elements of another set (y).
      - Since {(1, 5), (2, 8), (3, 11), (4, 14)} is a set containing ordered pairs, it satisfies the definition of a relation.

    - problemText: Does the equation $y = 3x - 1$ represent a relation?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, $y = 3x - 1$ represents a relation.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Consider what the equation $y = 3x - 1$ defines.
      - This equation generates an infinite set of points (x, y) that lie on a straight line.
      - Since a relation is defined as any set of ordered pairs connecting x and y, an equation that defines such a set (even
        if infinite) is a relation.

    - problemText: Is $y = x^2 + 5$ considered a relation in the Cartesian plane?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, $y = x^2 + 5$ is considered a relation.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the components of the given mathematical statement.
      - The equation relates the variable x (input) to the variable y (output) through a specific rule (squaring x and adding
        5).
      - This relationship results in an infinite collection of ordered pairs (x, y) which, by definition, constitutes a relation.

    - problemText: Identify if the correspondence between the age of a car (x) and its current market value (y) represents
        a relation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, this represents a relation.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine if the description links two variables.
      - The description connects the age of the car (x) to its market value (y).
      - Because for every age (x), there is a corresponding market value (y), this correspondence forms a set of ordered pairs
        (Age, Value), fulfilling the requirements of a relation.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Does the set of points {(-3, 9), (-1, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9)} qualify as a relation?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, the set qualifies as a relation.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Count the number of ordered pairs and examine their components.
      - The collection contains 6 distinct ordered pairs, each linking an x-coordinate to a y-coordinate.
      - Any collection of ordered pairs (finite or infinite) defines a connection between x and y and is therefore classified
        as a relation.

    preWrittenQuestions:
    - problemText: Is the set of ordered pairs {(-5, 10), (-2, 4), (0, 0), (3, -6)} a function?
      avatarIntro: Functions are special types of relations where every input has exactly one output. Let's check these sets
        to see if they meet that rule!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, it is a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the x-coordinates (inputs) in the set: -5, -2, 0, and 3.'
      - Check if any x-coordinate is repeated.
      - Since all x-coordinates are unique, the set satisfies the definition of a function.
      - 'Conclusion: The set {(-5, 10), (-2, 4), (0, 0), (3, -6)} is a function because no input value is mapped to more than
        one output value.'

    - problemText: Determine if the relation {(-3, 1), (-1, 0), (-3, 3)} is a function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, it is NOT a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the x-coordinates (inputs) in the relation: -3, -1, and -3.'
      - Observe that the x-coordinate -3 appears twice.
      - In the points (-3, 1) and (-3, 3), the input -3 is associated with two different outputs (1 and 3).
      - 'Conclusion: This relation fails the function test because a single input value (-3) is mapped to multiple output
        values.'

      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Check if the set {(1, 9), (2, -4), (3, 9), (4, 1), (5, -4)} satisfies the function definition.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, it is a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'List all the x-coordinates (inputs): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.'
      - 'List all the y-coordinates (outputs): 9, -4, 9, 1, -4.'
      - Examine the x-coordinates to see if any repeat. The x-coordinates (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are all unique.
      - Note that the y-coordinates 9 and -4 repeat, but this does not violate the function definition (it is acceptable for
        different inputs to have the same output).
      - 'Conclusion: Since every input has exactly one output, the set defines a function.'
      id: q2-3
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Is the set of ordered pairs {(-2, 1), (3, 4), (-2, 0), (1, 4)} a function?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, it is NOT a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Inspect the x-coordinates of the ordered pairs: -2, 3, -2, and 1.'
      - Identify the repeated x-coordinate. The value x = -2 appears in both the first point (-2, 1) and the third point (-2,
        0).
      - The input -2 is mapped to two different outputs (1 and 0).
      - 'Conclusion: The set is not a function because the input -2 does not have a unique output.'

    - problemText: Determine if the relation {(9, -1), (-4, 7), (1, 0)} is a function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, it is a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the domain (set of x-coordinates): 9, -4, and 1.'
      - Verify if any domain element is repeated.
      - Since 9, -4, and 1 are all distinct values, each input maps to exactly one output.
      - 'Conclusion: The relation satisfies the definition of a function.'

  title: Applying Vertical Line Test

    preWrittenQuestions:
    - problemText: A graph shows a straight line with a positive slope passing through the origin. Is this graph a function?
        Apply the vertical line test to justify your answer.
      avatarIntro: The Vertical Line Test is a quick visual tool. Let's practice determining if a graph represents a function!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, this graph is a function. When applying the vertical line test, every possible vertical line cuts
        the straight line at exactly one point. Since no x-value has more than one corresponding y-value, it satisfies the
        definition of a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the Vertical Line Test (VLT): If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, the graph
        is NOT a function.'
      - Imagine drawing vertical lines across the straight line graph.
      - Observe that regardless of where the vertical line is drawn, it will intersect the straight line only once.
      - Conclude that since the vertical line intersects the graph at most once everywhere, the graph represents a function.

      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: Consider the graph of an ellipse centered at the origin that is wider than it is tall. Does this curve
        pass the vertical line test?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, the ellipse fails the vertical line test. For any vertical line drawn within the horizontal boundaries
        of the ellipse (but not at the far sides), the line will cut the curve twice (once on the top half and once on the
        bottom half).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Visualize the shape of an ellipse centered at the origin.
      - Consider a vertical line passing through the middle section of the ellipse.
      - Note that this vertical line intersects the ellipse at two distinct points, meaning one input x-value corresponds
        to two output y-values.
      - Since the VLT fails (the line cuts the graph more than once), the ellipse does not represent a function.
      id: q3-2
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: State the definition of the Vertical Line Test (VLT) and explain the fundamental reason why this visual
        test works for identifying functions.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The Vertical Line Test states that a graph represents a function if and only if every vertical line drawn
        on the graph intersects the graph at most once. It works because a vertical line represents a single constant x-value
        (input). If that line cuts the graph twice or more, it means that single input x-value is associated with multiple
        output y-values, which violates the core definition of a function.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the VLT rule: A graph must be intersected by any vertical line at most once.'
      - 'Explain the significance of a vertical line: A vertical line represents a single domain element (x-value).'
      - 'Explain the implication of multiple intersections: If a vertical line cuts the graph multiple times, it means that
        single x-value yields multiple y-values.'
      - 'Relate this back to the function definition: A function requires that every input (x) has exactly one output (y).'
      id: q3-3
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: A graph displays a semi-circle that lies entirely above the x-axis. Does this graph represent a function?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, this graph represents a function. When applying the vertical line test, any vertical line drawn within
        the domain of the semi-circle will cut the graph exactly once. Thus, it passes the VLT.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Visualize the semi-circle lying above the x-axis.
      - Consider drawing vertical lines across this graph.
      - Since the semi-circle only includes the top half of the corresponding full circle, any vertical line will intersect
        the curve at a maximum of one point.
      - Conclude that because the line cuts the graph at most once, the semi-circle is a function.
      id: q3-4
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: Consider the graph of a vertical line defined by the equation $x = 4$. Explain why this specific graph
        fails the vertical line test and is therefore not a function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: This graph fails the vertical line test dramatically. The vertical line test requires that every vertical
        line cuts the graph at most once. If we draw a vertical line at $x=4$ (which is the graph itself), this line intersects
        the graph at infinitely many points along the entire length of the line. This means the input $x=4$ is associated
        with infinite possible y-values, immediately failing the function criterion.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the graph: It is a vertical line at a fixed x-value (x=4).'
      - Apply the VLT by considering a vertical line passing through x=4.
      - Note that the vertical line drawn at x=4 overlaps perfectly with the graph itself.
      - 'Determine the number of intersections: The vertical line intersects the graph infinitely many times.'
      - Conclude that because one input (x=4) has infinite outputs, the vertical line fails the VLT and is not a function.

    - problemText: How is the notation g(t) read in mathematics, particularly when dealing with the function g(t) = 4t - 5?
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start by making sure we understand the basic language of functions. Pay close attention
        to how we pronounce function notation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The notation g(t) is read as 'g of t'.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the function name (g) and the input variable (t).
      - Function notation (g(t)) is read by stating the function name first, followed by 'of', and then the input variable.
      - Therefore, g(t) is read as 'g of t'.

    - problemText: In the context of the function p(n) = n² + 2, what mathematical quantity or concept does the entire notation
        p(n) represent?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: p(n) represents the output value, the function value, or the result obtained when the input n is processed
        by the function rule p.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall that function notation is a way to express the relationship between input and output.
      - The variable inside the parentheses (n) is the input.
      - The entire expression p(n) stands for the result of the function operation.
      - Therefore, p(n) represents the output value associated with the input n.

        of the variable a.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: h is the name of the function (the function rule being applied), and a is the input variable (or independent
        variable) to be substituted into the rule.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the structure of function notation h(a).
      - The letter outside the parentheses (h) is conventionally used to name the specific function or rule.
      - The variable inside the parentheses (a) represents the value that goes into the function, known as the input.

      questionGroup: q4
    - problemText: In coordinate geometry, we often write equations as y = 5x + 2. How is the notation y = f(x) related to
        this, and what does it communicate about the relationship between x and y?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The notation y = f(x) is equivalent to saying y is the output of the function f when x is the input. It
        emphasizes that y is dependent on x according to the rule defined by f.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Understand the equivalence: y represents the dependent variable (output) and f(x) represents the function output.'
      - When we write y = f(x), we are explicitly stating that the value of y is determined entirely by applying the function
        rule f to the input value x.
      - This notation confirms that the relationship is functional, meaning for every input x, there is exactly one output
        y.
      id: q4-4
      questionGroup: q4
    - problemText: A common mistake is interpreting the notation q(x) as the multiplication of q by x. Explain why this interpretation
        is fundamentally incorrect in the context of functions like q(x) = x - 1.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: q(x) does not mean multiplication. The parentheses in function notation indicate that x is the input argument
        being substituted into the function rule named q, not being multiplied by q.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the purpose of function notation: to map an input to an output via a rule.'
      - In standard algebraic notation, adjacent terms or terms separated by parentheses usually imply multiplication, but
        this is an exception for function notation.
      - The notation q(x) specifically denotes 'the output of function q when the input is x', distinguishing it clearly from
        algebraic multiplication.

    - problemText: A function's domain is described as the set of all x-values defined from -3 to 5, including -3 but strictly
        excluding 5. Write the domain using interval notation.
      avatarIntro: Understanding how to translate descriptive language into mathematical notation is key to mastering domain
        and range. Remember what each type of bracket signifies!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Domain: [-3, 5)'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the variable being described. Since the question asks for the domain, we are looking at the x-values.
      - 'Identify the lower bound: -3.'
      - 'Identify the upper bound: 5.'
      - 'Determine the appropriate bracket for the lower bound: Since -3 is ''included'', use a square bracket [.'
      - 'Determine the appropriate bracket for the upper bound: Since 5 is ''strictly excluded'', use a round bracket ).'
      - 'Combine the bounds into the final interval notation: [-3, 5).'

    - problemText: Consider the function $f(x) = |x| + 2$. Knowing that the absolute value of any real number, $|x|$, is always
        non-negative (zero or positive), determine the range of this function and write it in interval notation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Range: [2, \u221e)'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The core component is $|x|$. Since $|x| \ge 0$ for all real numbers x.
      - 'The function $f(x)$ takes this minimum value (0) and adds 2: $f(x) = 0 + 2 = 2$. Therefore, the minimum output value
        (range minimum) is 2.'
      - Since $|x|$ can increase infinitely, $f(x)$ can also increase infinitely.
      - The range starts at 2 (inclusive) and goes towards positive infinity.
      - In interval notation, this is written as [2, \u221e). Note that infinity always uses a round bracket.

        are excluded. Write the range of this function using interval notation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Range: (-10, -1)'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify that the question is asking for the Range (output values or y-values).
      - Identify the lower bound (-10) and the upper bound (-1).
      - Since both endpoints are 'strictly between' the values, they are excluded.
      - Excluded endpoints require round brackets ( ).
      - The resulting interval notation is (-10, -1).

        the domain in interval notation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Domain: (\u221e, 12]'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The question asks for the Domain, which is the horizontal extent (x-values).
      - The x-values cover 'all real numbers up to' 12. This means the values start from negative infinity (-\u221e) and stop
        at 12.
      - Negative infinity is always represented by a round bracket (.
      - Since 12 is 'included', it is represented by a square bracket ].
      - The domain is written as (-\u221e, 12].

      finalAnswer: 'Range: (\u221e, \u221e)'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the type of function: $g(x) = 5x - 7$ is a linear function.'
      - A non-constant linear function extends infinitely in both the positive and negative y-directions.
      - Since there are no restrictions on the input (domain is all real numbers), the output (range) will also cover all
        real numbers.
      - 'The set of all real numbers is represented in interval notation from negative infinity to positive infinity: (-\u221e,

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, the sign does NOT change at $x = -3$. The factor $(x + 3)$ has power 4 (even). Since the power is even,
        the sign remains the same (positive on both sides of the zero). Graphically, the function touches the x-axis at $x

      finalAnswer: Horizontal shift right 1 unit.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Compare the two equations. The change involves replacing $x$ with $(x - 1)$ in the denominator.
      - This indicates a horizontal shift of the form $y = f(x - h)$.
      - Since we have $(x - 1)$, the value of $h$ is $+1$.

      avatarIntro: Understanding reflections is key to mastering function transformations! Let's start by looking at what
        happens when the negative sign is applied inside the function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Reflection in the y-axis. The negative sign inside the function affects the x-values: $(x, y) \to (-x,
        y)$. The graph flips horizontally, swapping the left and right sides.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the location of the negative sign (inside the function, affecting the input $x$).
      - Determine the corresponding reflection axis (negative inside implies reflection in the y-axis).
      - 'Explain the effect on the coordinates: The $x$-values are negated, while the $y$-values remain the same.'

        describe the effect on the range of the function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The equation is $y = -\sqrt{x}$. Since the reflection is in the x-axis, the negative sign is applied outside
        the function, negating all y-values. The original range $[0, \infty)$ becomes $(-\infty, 0]$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recognize that reflection in the x-axis requires a negative sign outside the function: $y = -f(x)$.'
      - Apply this rule to the base function $y = \sqrt{x}$ to obtain the new equation $y = -\sqrt{x}$.
      - Determine the original range of $y = \sqrt{x}$, which is $[0, \infty)$.

        why would they appear identical?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Reflection in the y-axis. The negative sign is applied inside the function, affecting the x-values. They
        appear identical because $y = x^2$ is an even function (symmetric about the y-axis), meaning $f(x) = f(-x)$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the location of the negative sign (inside the input term, affecting $x$). This indicates a reflection across
        the y-axis.
      - 'Calculate the result of the transformation: $y = (-x)^2 = x^2$.'
      - Explain that functions where $f(-x) = f(x)$ are symmetric about the y-axis (even functions). Reflecting a symmetric

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The reflection in the y-axis is $y = (-x)^3$. Simplifying this gives $y = -x^3$. This result shows that
        $f(-x) = -f(x)$, meaning the original function $y = x^3$ is an odd function (rotational symmetry about the origin).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recognize that reflection in the y-axis means replacing $x$ with $-x$: $y = f(-x)$.'
      - Apply this to $y = x^3$ to get the reflected equation $y = (-x)^3$.
      - 'Simplify the expression: Since the exponent is odd, $(-x)^3 = -x^3$.'
      - Compare the resulting function ($y = -x^3$) to the original function ($y = x^3$). Since $f(-x) = -f(x)$, the function
        is defined as odd.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Reflection in the x-axis. The negative sign is outside the function, meaning every y-coordinate is negated:
        $(x, y) \to (x, -y)$. The points that remain invariant are the x-intercepts (where $y=0$), because reflecting a point
        $(a, 0)$ across the x-axis results in $(a, -0)$ or $(a, 0)$ itself.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the negative sign location (outside the function, affecting the output $y$). This defines the transformation
        as a reflection in the x-axis.
      - 'Explain the effect on coordinates: $y$-values are negated while $x$-values are unchanged.'

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the fundamental property of absolute value: $|x|$ represents the distance from $x$ to 0 on the number line.'
      - Distance is inherently a non-negative quantity (it can be zero or positive, but never negative).
      - Therefore, the output of the absolute value function must always be greater than or equal to zero (i.e., $|x| \geq
        0$).

      - 'Step 3: Analyze the reflection. The negative sign outside the absolute value, $y = -|x|$, indicates a reflection
        across the x-axis, meaning the V-shape opens downward.'
      - 'Step 4: Since the highest point (vertex) is $y=0$ and the graph opens downward, the range consists of all values
        less than or equal to zero: $y \leq 0$.'

    - problemText: Describe how the graph of $y = 2|x|$ differs from the basic graph of $y = |x|$, specifically focusing on
        the shape of the V.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The graph of $y = 2|x|$ is vertically stretched by a factor of 2. It is narrower and steeper than $y =
        |x|$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Recognize that the coefficient $a=2$ in the equation $y = 2|x|$ represents a vertical scale factor.'
      - 'Step 2: A vertical scale factor $a > 1$ results in a vertical stretch.'
      - 'Step 3: Describe the visual effect: A vertical stretch makes the graph narrower and the rays steeper compared to
        the parent function $y = |x|$ (which has slopes of 1 and -1).'

    - problemText: The function $y = |x + 4| + 1$ is composed of two linear rays meeting at the vertex. State the slope (gradient)
        of the left ray ($x < -4$) and the slope of the right ray ($x > -4$).
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'Slope of the left ray ($x < -4$): -1. Slope of the right ray ($x > -4$): 1.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the transformations. The function $y = |x + 4| + 1$ is shifted left 4 units and up 1 unit. This
        translation moves the vertex to $(-4, 1)$, but does not change the orientation or stretch/compression.'
      - 'Step 2: Recall the slopes of the parent function $y = |x|$. The right side has a slope of 1, and the left side has
        a slope of -1.'
      - 'Step 3: Since there is no reflection or vertical stretch/compression ($a=1$), the slopes remain the same as the parent
        function, regardless of the translation.'
      - 'Step 4: The slope of the ray where $x$ is less than the vertex''s x-coordinate (the left ray) is -1. The slope of
        the ray where $x$ is greater than the vertex''s x-coordinate (the right ray) is 1.'

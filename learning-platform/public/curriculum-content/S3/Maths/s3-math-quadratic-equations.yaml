        by the equation $\frac{x+1}{x-3} = \frac{x-2}{x+5}$. Solve for the value of $x$. Clearly show the cross-multiplication
        step and verify the result against any defined restrictions.
      finalAnswer: 'x = 1/11 (Restriction: x \neq 3 and x \neq -5)'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the restrictions on $x$: $x \neq 3$ and $x \neq -5$.'
      - 'Clear the fractions using cross-multiplication: $(x+1)(x+5) = (x-2)(x-3)$.'
      - 'Expand both sides of the equation:'
      - 'Left side: $x^2 + 5x + x + 5 = x^2 + 6x + 5$.'
      - 'Right side: $x^2 - 3x - 2x + 6 = x^2 - 5x + 6$.'
      - 'Set the results equal: $x^2 + 6x + 5 = x^2 - 5x + 6$.'
      - 'Subtract $x^2$ from both sides, yielding a linear equation: $6x + 5 = -5x + 6$.'
      - 'Solve the linear equation: $11x = 1$.'

    - problemText: In optics, the relationship between object distance ($x$) and focal length can sometimes be modeled by
        complex fractional equations. Solve the equation $\frac{3}{x} + \frac{1}{x-1} = 5$. Show the process of finding the
        LCD, transforming the equation into a quadratic form, and finding the exact roots using the quadratic formula.
      finalAnswer: x = $\frac{9 + \sqrt{21}}{10}$ or x = $\frac{9 - \sqrt{21}}{10}$ (Both solutions are valid since neither is
        0 nor 1)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the LCD: $x(x-1)$. Note the restrictions: $x \neq 0$ and $x \neq 1$.'
      - 'Multiply the entire equation by the LCD: $x(x-1) \left( \frac{3}{x} + \frac{1}{x-1} \right) = 5x(x-1)$.'
      - 'Simplify the fractions: $3(x-1) + x = 5x^2 - 5x$.'
      - 'Expand and combine like terms: $3x - 3 + x = 5x^2 - 5x$, which simplifies to $4x - 3 = 5x^2 - 5x$.'
      - Rearrange into the standard quadratic form $5x^2 - 9x + 3 = 0$.
      - 'Use the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-(-9) \pm \sqrt{(-9)^2 - 4(5)(3)}}{2(5)}$.'
      - 'Calculate the roots: $x = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 60}}{10} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{21}}{10}$.'
      - Verify the solutions. Since $\sqrt{21}$ is between 4 and 5, neither solution results in $x=0$ or $x=1$. Both are valid
        solutions.

        finding the time each person takes individually. State the domain restrictions and verify your solution against the
        context of the problem.
      avatarIntro: Work rate problems are perfect examples of how fractional equations model real-world scenarios. Remember

    - problemText: 'A farmer is studying the relationship between the amount of fertilizer applied (x, in units) and the resulting
        crop yield (Y, in arbitrary units). The relationship is modeled by the quadratic function $Y(x) = -x^2 + 10x - 9$.
        Use the graphical representation of this model to determine the following:

        (a) What amount of fertilizer should be used to achieve the maximum crop yield?

        (b) At what fertilizer application levels does the yield drop to zero (break-even points)?'

        maximizing profit or minimizing risk. Let's analyze these models.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the mathematical features corresponding to the real-world questions.
      - 'Question (a) asks for maximum yield, which corresponds to the x-coordinate of the vertex. Calculate the vertex using
        $x = -b/(2a)$: $x = -10 / (2 \cdot -1) = 5$.'
      - Question (b) asks for zero yield, which corresponds to the x-intercepts ($Y=0$). Solve $0 = -x^2 + 10x - 9$. Factoring
        gives $(x-1)(x-9)=0$, so $x=1$ and $x=9$.
      - 'Interpret the results: Maximum yield occurs at 5 units. The yield is zero when applying 1 unit (starting point) or

      finalAnswer: (a) 2.5 km. (b) No, the cable never reaches sea level because the graph (parabola) opens upwards and its
        minimum point (vertex) is above D=0, meaning there are no real x-intercepts.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'To find the minimum depth, calculate the vertex since the parabola opens upwards ($a=0.5 > 0$). Calculate $x = -b/(2a)$:
        $x = -(-5) / (2 \cdot 0.5) = 5$.'
      - 'Substitute $x=5$ back into the function: $D(5) = 0.5(5)^2 - 5(5) + 15 = 12.5 - 25 + 15 = 2.5$ km.'
      - 'To determine if the cable reaches sea level, check for x-intercepts (where D=0). Calculate the discriminant: $\Delta
        = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(0.5)(15) = 25 - 30 = -5$.'
      - Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots (no x-intercepts). Since the minimum depth is 2.5 km (a

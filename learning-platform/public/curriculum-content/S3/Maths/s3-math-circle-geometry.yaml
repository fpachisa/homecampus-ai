      - Therefore, triangle OAC is an isosceles triangle.
      - In an isosceles triangle, the base angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Thus, $\angle OCA = \angle OAC$.

      - 'Recall the definition of a radius: a segment connecting the center of the circle to a point on the circumference.'
      - O is the center of the circle.
      - OB connects the center O to the circumference point B (the endpoint of the diameter).

      - The radius (r) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord length (c/2), and the
        perpendicular distance (d). r = 20 cm, c/2 = 32 cm / 2 = 16 cm.
      - 'Apply the Pythagorean theorem: $r^2 = d^2 + (c/2)^2$.'
      - $20^2 = d^2 + 16^2$
      - $400 = d^2 + 256$
      - $d^2 = 400 - 256 = 144$
      - Therefore, $d = \sqrt{144} = 12$ cm.

      finalAnswer: 15 cm. Chord CD is further from the center.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - We need to find the distance (d) for both chords.
      - 'For Chord AB (c=48, c/2=24): $d_{AB}^2 = r^2 - (c/2)^2 = 25^2 - 24^2 = 625 - 576 = 49$. $d_{AB} = 7$ cm.'

      - The shorter chord (CD) has a distance of 15 cm from the center.
      - Since $15 > 7$, Chord CD is further from the center than Chord AB.

        than the length of chord CD (AB > CD). Let $d_1$ be the perpendicular distance from O to AB, and $d_2$ be the perpendicular
        distance from O to CD. Prove geometrically that $d_1 < d_2$.

          showMidpoint: true
          equalChords: false
          highlightChord: none
      finalAnswer: Proof requires showing that since AB > CD, (AB/2) > (CD/2). Using $d^2 = r^2 - (c/2)^2$, if (c/2) increases,
        $d^2$ must decrease, hence $d_1 < d_2$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Both chords relate to the radius (r) via the Pythagorean theorem: $d^2 = r^2 - (c/2)^2$. Since they are in the same
        circle, r is constant.'
      - We are given $AB > CD$. Dividing by 2, we get $(AB/2) > (CD/2)$.
      - 'Substitute into the Pythagorean relationship: $d_1^2 = r^2 - (AB/2)^2$ and $d_2^2 = r^2 - (CD/2)^2$.'
      - Since $(AB/2)^2$ is a larger value being subtracted from the constant $r^2$ than $(CD/2)^2$, it follows that $d_1^2
        < d_2^2$.
      - Therefore, the perpendicular distance $d_1$ (to the longer chord AB) must be less than the perpendicular distance
        $d_2$ (to the shorter chord CD). Longer chords are closer to the center.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Determine the square of the radius ($r^2$) using the data for Chord AB. $r^2 = d_1^2 + (c_1/2)^2$.'
      - $r^2 = 9^2 + (30/2)^2 = 81 + 15^2 = 81 + 225 = 306$. $r^2 = 306$.
      - 'Step 2: Use $r^2$ to find half the length of Chord CD ($c_2/2$), given $d_2 = 5$ cm. $(c_2/2)^2 = r^2 - d_2^2$.'

      - Line A intersects the circle at two points, satisfying the definition of a secant line.
      - Line B intersects the circle at exactly one point, satisfying the definition of a tangent line.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the complete definition of a tangent line.
      - 'A tangent must meet two criteria: 1) Touch the circle at exactly one point, AND 2) Never cross into the circle''s
        interior.'
      - If the line crosses into the interior, regardless of touching the edge first, it violates the tangent property and
        is classified as a secant (assuming it exits the circle again) or a line containing a chord.

      finalAnswer: $2\angle ACB = 2\angle ADB$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The proof relies on the transitive property of equality (if a=b and c=b, then a=c).
      - Since both $2\angle ACB$ and $2\angle ADB$ are equal to $\angle AOB$, they must be equal to each other.
      - The resulting algebraic statement is $2\angle ACB = 2\angle ADB$.

    - problemText: An astronomer tracks two satellites, C and D, orbiting along a path defined by the circular segment AB.
        The angle subtended at the centre O is $\angle AOB = 70^{\circ}$. During the proof that $\angle ACB = \angle ADB$,
        we establish the intermediate relationship $2\angle ACB = 2\angle ADB$. Explain the final logical step required to
        conclude definitively that $\angle ACB = \angle ADB$.

      finalAnswer: Divide both sides of the equation $2\angle ACB = 2\angle ADB$ by 2. This mathematical operation establishes
        that $\angle ACB = \angle ADB$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The intermediate step provides the equality $2\angle ACB = 2\angle ADB$.
      - The goal is to isolate $\angle ACB$ and $\angle ADB$.
      - The required logical step is to divide the entire equation by 2.

      finalAnswer: $\angle ACB = 60^{\circ}$ and $\angle ADB = 60^{\circ}$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Use the Angle at Centre Theorem: Angle at circumference = (1/2) * Angle at centre.'
      - 'Calculate $\angle ACB$: $\angle ACB = 120^{\circ} \div 2 = 60^{\circ}$.'
      - Since both $\angle ACB$ and $\angle ADB$ are subtended by the same arc AB and lie in the same segment, they must be
        equal.
      - Therefore, $\angle ADB = 60^{\circ}$.

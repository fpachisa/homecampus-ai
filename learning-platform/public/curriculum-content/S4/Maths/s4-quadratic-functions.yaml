        values of the leading coefficient $a$, the linear coefficient $b$, and the constant term $c$.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Understanding the standard form of a quadratic function is the first step in mastering this topic.
        Let's start with identifying the key components.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, it is a quadratic function. a = 5, b = 4, c = 3
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Compare the given function, $y = 5x^2 + 4x + 3$, to the standard form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.'
      - 'Step 2: Since the highest power of $x$ is 2 and $a=5$ (which is not zero), the function is quadratic.'
      - 'Step 3: Identify the coefficients: $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, $b$ is the coefficient of $x$, and $c$ is the
        constant term.'

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Rewrite the function in standard form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. $f(x) = -2x^2 + 0x + 10$.'
      - 'Step 2: Identify the leading coefficient $a$ (coefficient of $x^2$). $a = -2$.'
      - 'Step 3: Identify the linear coefficient $b$ (coefficient of $x$). Since there is no $x$ term, $b = 0$.'

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Explain why the function $y = 4x^3 - 2x + 8$ is NOT a quadratic function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It is not a quadratic function because the highest power (degree) of $x$ is 3, not 2. For a function to
        be quadratic, the highest degree must be 2.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $g(x) = -4x^2 - 6x - 15$ is the quadratic function. a = -4, b = -6, c = -15.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Analyze $h(x) = 5^x$. Since the variable $x$ is in the exponent, this is an exponential function, not quadratic.'
      - 'Step 2: Analyze $g(x) = -4x^2 - 6x - 15$. This function is in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c$, with the highest
        power of $x$ being 2. This is the quadratic function.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $y = -x^2 - 8x + 1$. a = -1, b = -8, c = 1.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: To convert from function notation $g(x)$ to $y =$ notation, simply replace $g(x)$ with $y$: $y = -x^2 - 8x
        + 1$.'
      - 'Step 2: Identify the coefficient $a$. Since $a$ is the coefficient of $x^2$, and $-x^2$ is equivalent to $-1x^2$,

    - problemText: Consider the quadratic function $y = -4x^2$. Observing the coefficient $a$, does this parabola open upward
        (like a U) or downward (like an inverted U)?
      avatarIntro: Understanding how the coefficient 'a' affects a parabola is key to predicting its shape without graphing.
        Let's analyze the direction first!

        toolName: parabola
        parameters:
          a: -4

      finalAnswer: The parabola opens downward.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the coefficient $a$. In $y = -4x^2$, $a = -4$.
      - 'Recall the rule for opening direction: If $a > 0$, the parabola opens upward. If $a < 0$, the parabola opens downward.'
      - Since $a = -4$ is negative ($a < 0$), the parabola opens downward.

          - 12
      finalAnswer: Wider (compressed)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the coefficient $a$. Here, $a = 0.75$.
      - 'Determine the absolute value of $a$: $|a| = |0.75| = 0.75$.'
      - Compare $|a|$ to 1. Since $0.75 < 1$, the parabola is wider than the standard parabola $y = x^2$ (where $|a|=1$).
        This is also known as a vertical compression.

          - 18
      finalAnswer: $|a|$ is greater than 1 ($|2| > 1$). This means the parabola is narrower (vertically stretched).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the coefficient $a$: $a = 2$.'
      - 'Calculate the absolute value: $|a| = |2| = 2$.'
      - Compare $|a|$ to 1. Since $2 > 1$, the parabola is narrower than $y = x^2$.

          - 2
      finalAnswer: $f(x) = -3x^2$ is thinner.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The width of a parabola is determined by the absolute value of coefficient $a$. The larger the absolute value $|a|$,
        the thinner the parabola.
      - 'Calculate $|a|$ for $f(x)$: $|-3| = 3$.'
      - 'Calculate $|a|$ for $g(x)$: $|0.25| = 0.25$.'
      - 'Compare the absolute values: Since $3 > 0.25$, the parabola $f(x) = -3x^2$ is thinner.'

          - -10
          - 2
      finalAnswer: It opens downward and is wider than $y = x^2$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the opening direction using the sign of $a$. Since $a = -0.5$ is negative, the parabola opens downward.
      - Determine the width using the absolute value of $a$. $|a| = |-0.5| = 0.5$.
      - Since $|a| < 1$ ($0.5 < 1$), the parabola is wider (compressed) compared to $y = x^2$.

      finalAnswer: Horizontal shift left 1 unit, Vertical shift up 5 units, and Vertical compression (widening) by a factor
        of 0.5.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the vertex $(h, k)$ from the equation: $h = -1$ (from $x + 1$) and $k = 5$.'
      - 'The horizontal shift corresponds to $h$: $h = -1$ means a shift left 1 unit.'
      - 'The vertical shift corresponds to $k$: $k = 5$ means a shift up 5 units.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Zero x-intercepts.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - To determine the number of real x-intercepts, we can use the discriminant, $D = b^2 - 4ac$.
      - 'Identify the coefficients: a = 1, b = 2, and c = 3.'

      finalAnswer: Zero x-intercepts.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The x-intercepts are the points where the graph crosses or touches the horizontal x-axis.
      - Examine the graph. Since the parabola opens downward and its highest point (vertex) is below the x-axis, it never
        reaches or crosses the x-axis.
      - Therefore, the parabola has zero x-intercepts.

    - problemText: A designer is calculating dimensions such that the square of the length $x$ does not exceed five times
        the length. Solve the inequality $x^2 \leq 5x$ to find the possible range of $x$ (assuming $x \geq 0$).
      avatarIntro: Quadratic inequalities are powerful tools for modeling real-world constraints. Remember to handle non-strict
        inequalities correctly by including the endpoints!

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Rewrite the inequality in standard form: $x^2 - 5x \leq 0$.'
      - Find the critical values by solving $x^2 - 5x = 0$, which factors as $x(x - 5) = 0$. Critical values are $x = 0$ and
        $x = 5$.
      - Use a sign diagram or test points. Since the parabola $y = x^2 - 5x$ opens upward, it is negative (or zero) between
        the roots.
      - Since the inequality is non-strict (\u2264), the endpoints are included. The solution is $0 \leq x \leq 5$.

      - 'Find the critical values by factoring the quadratic: $(x - 6)(x + 2) = 0$. Critical values are $x = 6$ and $x = -2$.'
      - Since the parabola opens upward, the function is greater than or equal to zero outside the roots.
      - Include the endpoints because the inequality is non-strict (\u2265). The solution is $x \leq -2$ or $x \geq 6$.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Factor the quadratic expression: $t^2 - 4t + 4 = (t - 2)^2$.'
      - The inequality becomes $(t - 2)^2 \geq 0$.
      - Since the square of any real number is always non-negative (greater than or equal to zero), this inequality is always
        true for all real values of $t$.

      finalAnswer: x = -3
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Factor the quadratic expression: $x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2$.'
      - The inequality becomes $(x + 3)^2 \leq 0$.
      - Since the square of any real number must be non-negative, $(x + 3)^2$ can never be less than zero.
      - Therefore, the only way for the inequality to hold is if $(x + 3)^2$ equals zero. This occurs only when $x + 3 = 0$,
        so $x = -3$.

          caption: There are no real roots, and the function is always positive.
      finalAnswer: \text{No solution } (\emptyset)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Analyze the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ for the quadratic $x^2 + 2x + 3$.
      - Calculate $D = (2)^2 - 4(1)(3) = 4 - 12 = -8$.
      - Since the discriminant $D$ is negative, there are no real roots, meaning the parabola never crosses the x-axis.
      - Since the leading coefficient $a = 1$ is positive, the parabola opens upward and is always positive ($x^2 + 2x + 3
        > 0$ for all real $x$).
      - Therefore, it is impossible for $x^2 + 2x + 3$ to be less than or equal to zero. The solution is no solution.

      finalAnswer: Angle R = 75°, Angle Q = 105°, Angle S = 105°.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the angle opposite to P, which is R. Opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, so Angle R = 75°.
      - Identify the angles adjacent to P, which are Q and S. Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add up
        to 180°).
      - 'Calculate the measure of the adjacent angles: 180° - 75° = 105°.'
      - Therefore, Angle Q = 105° and Angle S = 105°.
      - The four angles are 75°, 105°, 75°, 105°.

      finalAnswer: Perimeter = 32 mm. Smallest interior angle = 70°.
      stepByStepGuideline:

          highlightMode: none
          caption: Definition check for quadrilaterals
      finalAnswer: False. A rhombus is defined as a quadrilateral with four equal sides. Since a parallelogram is any quadrilateral
        with two pairs of parallel sides (which implies opposite sides are equal), a rhombus satisfies the definition of a
        parallelogram. It is a special type of parallelogram.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define a parallelogram: A quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel.'
      - 'Define a rhombus: A quadrilateral with all four sides equal.'
      - 'Analyze the relationship: If all four sides are equal (rhombus), then opposite sides must be equal, which is a key
        property derived from the definition of a parallelogram.'
      - Conclude that a rhombus satisfies the requirements to be classified as a parallelogram.

        the length of the slanted edge ($s$) is 10 cm, and the vertical drop distance ($h$), marked with a small square symbol,
        is 8 cm.


        Which measurement, 10 cm or 8 cm, represents the perpendicular height ($h$) used for calculating the area of the sign?
        Justify your choice by referring to the geometric symbol used.'
      avatarIntro: Distinguishing between height and slant side is crucial for calculating the area of parallelograms. Pay
        close attention to the symbols in the diagram!
      mathTool:
        toolName: parallelogram
        parameters:
          base: 15
          height: 8
          slantSide: 10
          showPerpendicular: true
          highlightMode: height
          showRightAngle: true
          caption: Perpendicular height (h) is at 90° to the base, NOT the slant side (s)
      finalAnswer: The perpendicular height (h) is 8 cm. This is because the small square symbol indicates a 90° angle (perpendicularity)
        between the height line and the base. The 10 cm measurement is the slant side, which is not perpendicular to the base.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition: Perpendicular height is the distance measured at a 90° angle to the base.'
      - 'Identify the symbol: The small square in the diagram marks the right angle (90°) relationship.'
      - 'Match the symbol to the measurement: The 8 cm line is marked with the right angle symbol, confirming it is the perpendicular
        height.'
      - 'Conclusion: The 10 cm measurement is the slant side, which cannot be used for the area calculation.'

    - problemText: 'The parallelogram below has a base of 20 units. Its perpendicular height ($h$) is 12 units, and its slant
        side ($s$) is 15 units.


        Explain, using concepts related to right-angled triangles, why the perpendicular height is always shorter than the
        slant side in any non-rectangular parallelogram.'
      mathTool:
        toolName: parallelogram
        parameters:
          base: 20
          height: 12
          slantSide: 15
          showPerpendicular: true
          highlightMode: height
          showRightAngle: true
          caption: Perpendicular height (h) is at 90° to the base, NOT the slant side (s)
      finalAnswer: The perpendicular height forms one leg (a side adjacent to the right angle) of a right-angled triangle,
        where the slant side acts as the hypotenuse. Since the hypotenuse is defined as the side opposite the right angle,
        it is always the longest side in a right-angled triangle. Therefore, the perpendicular height (leg) must be shorter
        than the slant side (hypotenuse).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Visualize the right triangle: The perpendicular height, the slant side, and a segment of the base form a right-angled
        triangle.'
      - 'Identify the roles: In this triangle, the perpendicular height is one of the two legs, and the slant side is the
        hypotenuse.'
      - 'Apply Pythagorean Theorem concept: The hypotenuse is geometrically defined as the longest side of a right triangle.'
      - 'Conclude the relationship: Since the slant side is the hypotenuse and the perpendicular height is a leg, the height
        must be shorter than the slant side.'

        The diagram provides the slant side length ($s$) as 13 meters. The painter knows the area formula is $A = b \times
        h$.


        Can the area be calculated immediately using only the base and the slant side? If not, what specific piece of information
        is missing and why is it necessary?'

          showRightAngle: true
          caption: Perpendicular height (h) is at 90° to the base, NOT the slant side (s)
      finalAnswer: No, the area cannot be calculated immediately. The missing piece of information is the perpendicular height
        ($h$). The area formula requires the perpendicular height because it measures the true vertical separation between
        the base and the opposite side (at 90°), whereas the slant side (13 m) measures only the edge length.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the formula: Area of a parallelogram requires base multiplied by perpendicular height ($A = b \times h$).'
      - 'Analyze given information: We have the base (18 m) and the slant side (13 m).'
      - 'Identify the necessity of height: The slant side is not the height unless the figure is a rectangle.'

        $h = 8$ cm is shown with a right-angle marker, and measurement $s = 10$ cm is shown along the slanted side.


        Explain the fundamental difference between the perpendicular height ($h$) and the slant side ($s$). Why must the calculation
        of the panel’s area use the $h = 8$ cm measurement?'

          showRightAngle: true
          caption: Perpendicular height (h) is at 90° to the base, NOT the slant side (s)
      finalAnswer: The slant side ($s=10$ cm) is the actual length of the side of the parallelogram. The perpendicular height
        ($h=8$ cm) is the shortest distance between the base and the opposite side, defined by being measured at a 90° angle
        (perpendicular) to the base. We must use $h=8$ cm for the area because the area formula, $A = b \times h$, relies
        on the vertical separation (height) that is aligned perpendicularly with the base, not the length of the slanted boundary.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define Perpendicular Height (h): It is the measurement taken at a 90° angle to the base.'
      - 'Define Slant Side (s): It is the length of the boundary edge.'
      - 'Explain the difference: $h$ measures separation/distance; $s$ measures boundary length.'

        If we want to find the area of the shadow, state the correct measurement to use for the height and set up the final

          caption: Perpendicular height (h) is at 90° to the base, NOT the slant side (s)
      finalAnswer: 'The correct measurement for the height is 12 feet, as this is the perpendicular height (h). The area calculation
        is: Area = Base × Perpendicular Height = 20 ft × 12 ft = 240 square feet. The 15 feet measurement (slant side) is

        edges measure $15 \text{ mm}$ and $12 \text{ mm}$. Determine the perpendicular height ($h$) of the beam's cross-section.
        Express your answer as a fraction or rounded to two decimal places.

      finalAnswer: $h = 6.67 \text{ mm}$ (or $20/3 \text{ mm}$)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Start with the area formula: $A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h$.'
      - 'Substitute the known values: $90 = \frac{1}{2}(15 + 12)h$.'
      - 'Simplify the sum of the bases: $90 = \frac{1}{2}(27)h$.'
      - 'Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction: $180 = 27h$.'
      - 'Solve for $h$: $h = 180 \div 27$.'
      - Simplify the fraction $180/27 = 20/3 \approx 6.67 \text{ mm}$.

    - problemText: A commercial swimming pool is being designed with a trapezoidal deep end. The bottom surface of this section
        needs tiling. The parallel edges of the trapezium measure 15 m and 10 m, and the perpendicular length (height) is
        30 m. If specialized anti-slip tiles cost $20 per square meter, calculate the total cost to tile the bottom surface.

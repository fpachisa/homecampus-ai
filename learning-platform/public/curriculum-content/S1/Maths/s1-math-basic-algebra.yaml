        speech.text: Which terms are like terms in the expression seven a plus two b minus four c minus twelve a minus one?
        display.content: Which terms are like terms in the expression $7a + 2b - 4c - 12a - 1$?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $7a$ and $-12a$ are like terms.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall that like terms must have the exact same variable(s) raised to the exact same power.
      - 'Examine the terms: $7a$, $2b$, $-4c$, $-12a$, and $-1$.'
      - Compare the terms based on their variables.
      - The terms $7a$ and $-12a$ both contain the variable $a$. Therefore, they are like terms.

        speech.text: Explain why the terms four x squared and four x are NOT like terms, even though they have the same coefficient.
        display.content: Explain why the terms $4x^2$ and $4x$ are NOT like terms, even though they have the same coefficient.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: They are not like terms because they have different powers. $4x^2$ has the variable $x$ raised to the power
        of 2, while $4x$ has $x$ raised to the power of 1. Like terms must have the same variable AND the same power.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define like terms: they must have identical variables and identical powers.'
      - 'Identify the variables and powers in the first term, $4x^2$: variable $x$, power 2.'
      - 'Identify the variables and powers in the second term, $4x$: variable $x$, power 1.'
      - Conclude that since the powers ($2$ and $1$) are different, the terms are not like terms.

          of the term containing only y?
        display.content: Consider the expression $9y^2 - y + 10$. What is the constant term, and what is the coefficient of
          the term containing only $y$?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The constant term is $10$. The coefficient of the term containing only $y$ (which is $-y$) is $-1$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the constant term: this is the term that does not have any variable attached. In $9y^2 - y + 10$, the constant
        term is $10$.'
      - 'Identify the term containing only $y$: this is $-y$.'
      - Recall that if a variable appears without an explicit number, the coefficient is 1 or $-1$. Since the term is $-y$,
        the coefficient is $-1$.

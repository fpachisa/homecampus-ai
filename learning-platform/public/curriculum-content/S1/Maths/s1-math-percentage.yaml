        as 75%, how would the true rate (0.75%) compare to the mistaken rate (75%)?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 0.75% is significantly smaller than 75%. 0.75% means 0.75 cents earned per $100 saved, while 75% would
        mean $75 earned per $100 saved, which is 100 times larger.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Define 0.75% as 0.0075 in decimal form.
      - Define 75% as 0.75 in decimal form.
      - Compare the two values (0.0075 vs 0.75) to demonstrate that the decimal placement is critical.

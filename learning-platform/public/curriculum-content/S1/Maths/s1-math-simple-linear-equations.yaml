      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start with balancing equations. Remember, whatever you do to one side, you must do to the
        other to keep the equation true.

        toolName: balanceScale
        parameters:
          leftSide: x + 9
          rightSide: '20'
          operation: subtract
          operationValue: '9'
          showInverse: true
      finalAnswer: x = 11
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the operation being performed on the variable x (addition of 9).
      - 'To isolate x, perform the inverse operation: subtraction.'
      - 'Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: (x + 9) - 9 = 20 - 9.'

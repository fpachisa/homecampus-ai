      finalAnswer: 4:6, 6:9, 8:12 (or any three ratios where the second term is 1.5 times the first)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - To find equivalent ratios, multiply both terms of the original ratio (2:3) by the same integer.
      - 'Multiply by 2: (2 × 2) : (3 × 2) = 4:6'
      - 'Multiply by 3: (2 × 3) : (3 × 3) = 6:9'

          showSteps: true
      finalAnswer: Yes, the ratios 3:5 and 9:15 are equivalent.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - We compare the original ratio 3:5 with the new ratio 9:15.
      - 'Determine the factor needed to convert the first term: 3 × ? = 9. The factor is 3.'
      - 'Apply the same factor to the second term: 5 × 3 = 15.'
      - Since 3 × 3 = 9 and 5 × 3 = 15, the ratios are equivalent.

      finalAnswer: Y = 18
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the relationship between the known second terms: 4 to 24.'
      - To go from 4 to 24, we must multiply by 6 (since 4 × 6 = 24).
      - To maintain the equivalent ratio, we must multiply the first term (3) by the same number (6).
      - Y = 3 × 6 = 18.

        It then passes a much longer 640 m bridge completely in 42 seconds, maintaining the same constant speed. Find the
        length of the freight train in meters.
      avatarIntro: This problem requires careful use of the distance formula where the train's length must be added to the
        tunnel's length. Set up two equations and solve algebraically!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 200 m
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let L be the length of the train in meters (m) and S be the constant speed of the train in meters per second (m/s).
      - When a train passes a bridge completely, the total distance covered is the length of the bridge plus the length of
        the train.
      - 'For the first bridge (400 m): Distance = L + 400 m, Time = 30 s. Speed S = (L + 400) / 30.'
      - 'For the second bridge (640 m): Distance = L + 640 m, Time = 42 s. Speed S = (L + 640) / 42.'
      - 'Since the speed S is constant, set the two expressions equal: (L + 400) / 30 = (L + 640) / 42.'
      - 'Simplify the fractions by dividing 30 and 42 by their common factor, 6: (L + 400) / 5 = (L + 640) / 7.'
      - 'Cross-multiply: 7(L + 400) = 5(L + 640).'
      - 'Expand the equation: 7L + 2800 = 5L + 3200.'

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Define speeds in the same unit. Alice's speed (R_A) = 4.5 km/h.
      - 'Convert Ben''s speed (R_B) from m/s to km/h: R_B = 1 m/s * (3600 s / 1 h) * (1 km / 1000 m). R_B = 3600 / 1000 km/h

        it take Gary to paint the wall alone?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 13 hours 30 minutes
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let R_G be Gary's rate (fraction of wall painted per hour) and R_F be Fiona's rate.
      - Fiona works 25% faster than Gary, so R_F = 1.25 * R_G = (5/4) * R_G.
      - When working together, their combined rate (R_C) completes the job (1 wall) in 6 hours. R_C = 1/6 wall/hour.
      - 'Set up the combined rate equation: R_F + R_G = R_C.'
      - (5/4)R_G + R_G = 1/6.
      - 'Combine the terms for R_G: (5/4 + 4/4)R_G = 1/6. (9/4)R_G = 1/6.'
      - 'Solve for Gary''s rate (R_G): R_G = (1/6) * (4/9) = 4/54 = 2/27 wall/hour.'
      - 'The time T_G required for Gary to paint the wall alone is 1 / R_G: T_G = 1 / (2/27) = 27/2 hours.'
      - 'Convert the time to hours and minutes: 27/2 hours = 13.5 hours.'
      - 13.5 hours is 13 hours and (0.5 * 60) minutes, which is 13 hours 30 minutes.

      - 'Clara’s Weight: $15,000 × 18 = 270,000.'
      - 'David’s Weight: $20,000 × 18 = 360,000.'
      - 'Eliza’s Weight: $21,000 × 24 = 504,000.'
      - 'Step 4: Calculate the total weighted investment. Total Weight = 270,000 + 360,000 + 504,000 = 1,134,000.'
      - 'Step 5: Determine Eliza''s share of the ratio. Eliza''s Share = 504,000 / 1,134,000 ≈ 0.44444...'
      - 'Step 6: Calculate Eliza''s profit share. Eliza''s Profit = $95,000 × (504,000 / 1,134,000) = $42,222.22. Wait, let
        me recheck the calculation of 504000/1134000 * 95000. 504 / 1134 = 4/9. 95000 * 4 / 9 = 42222.22. Let me review the
        final answer provided in my thought process ($33,250) vs the calculated answer ($42,222.22). Ah, I must have made
        a calculation error in my mental check. Let''s recalculate the weights carefully.'
      - 'C: 15k * 18 = 270k'
      - 'D: 20k * 18 = 360k'
      - 'E: 21k * 24 = 504k'
      - 'Total: 1134k. E''s Share: 504k / 1134k. Profit: 95000 * (504 / 1134) = $42,222.22. I will use $42,222 based on rounding
        to the nearest dollar.'
      - Let's check if $33,250 results from any other interpretation. 33250 / 95000 = 0.35. 0.35 * 1134k = 396.9k. This does
        not match E's weight. I will proceed with the calculated value.

    - problemText: 'A cargo lorry leaves a depot at 8:00 AM traveling north at a constant speed of 60 km/h. A delivery van
        leaves the same depot 1 hour and 15 minutes later, following the same route at a constant speed of 90 km/h.

        (a) Calculate the distance from the depot (in km) where the delivery van first overtakes the lorry.

        (b) If the van stops for a mandatory 15-minute break exactly 100 km into its journey, calculate the total time (in
        minutes) the van takes, starting from its departure time, to successfully overtake the lorry.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (a) 225 km (b) 195 minutes
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Given: Lorry speed = 60 km/h. Van speed = 90 km/h. Lorry starts 1 hour 15 minutes earlier (1.25 hours). Van starts
        at 9:15 AM.'
      - 'Step 1 (a): Calculate the head start distance covered by the lorry. Head Start Time = 1.25 hours. Head Start Distance
        = 60 km/h × 1.25 h = 75 km.'
      - 'Step 2 (a): Calculate the relative speed of the van closing the gap. Relative Speed = 90 km/h - 60 km/h = 30 km/h.'
      - 'Step 3 (a): Calculate the time taken for the van to close the gap and overtake. Time to Overtake = 75 km / 30 km/h
        = 2.5 hours.'
      - 'Step 4 (a): Calculate the distance from the depot where overtaking occurs. Distance = Van Speed × Time = 90 km/h
        × 2.5 h = 225 km.'
      - 'Step 5 (b): Calculate the time the van takes to reach 100 km. $T_{100} = 100 km / 90 km/h = 10/9$ hours (approx 1.111
        h).'
      - 'Step 6 (b): Calculate the position of the lorry when the van reaches 100 km. Time elapsed for lorry = 1.25 h + 10/9
        h ≈ 2.361 h. Lorry Distance = 60 km/h × 2.361 h ≈ 141.67 km.'
      - 'Step 7 (b): Calculate the distance the lorry travels during the van''s 15-minute break (0.25 h). Distance Lorry travels
        during break = 60 km/h × 0.25 h = 15 km.'
      - 'Step 8 (b): Calculate the new gap distance when the van resumes (at 100 km). New Lorry Distance = 141.67 km + 15
        km = 156.67 km. New Gap = 156.67 km - 100 km = 56.67 km.'
      - 'Step 9 (b): Calculate the time required to close the new gap. $T_{close, new} = 56.67 km / 30 km/h = 1.888...$ hours
        (17/9 hours).'
      - 'Step 10 (b): Calculate the total time the van takes from departure (9:15 AM). Total Van Time = $T_{100}$ + $T_{break}$
        + $T_{close, new}$ = $10/9$ h + $0.25$ h + $17/9$ h. Total Van Time = $27/9$ h + $0.25$ h = 3 hours + 0.25 hours =
        3.25 hours.'
      - 'Step 11 (b): Convert total time to minutes. 3.25 hours × 60 min/h = 195 minutes.'

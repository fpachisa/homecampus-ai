    - problemText: A deep-sea research vessel records its depth as $\text{-400}$ meters. Interpret what this negative altitude
        means in relation to the ocean surface.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The vessel is 400 meters below sea level (where sea level is 0 meters altitude).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the zero reference point, which is sea level.
      - Understand that altitude measurements use positive numbers for heights above the reference point and negative numbers
        for depths below it.
      - 'Combine the magnitude and direction: $\text{-400}$ meters means 400 meters in the downward direction from sea level.'

    - problemText: "After a difficult month, a small business reports a net profit of $\\text{-}\\\text{150}$. Describe what\
        \ this negative value tells us about the business's financial situation."
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The business did not make a profit; instead, it incurred a loss of $\$150$ (its expenses exceeded its revenue
        by $\$150$).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Understand that in financial contexts, profit is positive and loss is negative.
      - The zero point is breaking even (where revenue equals expenses).
      - "A value of $\\text{-}\\\text{150}$ indicates that the result is $\\$150$ below the break-even point, signifying a\
        \ loss."

    - problemText: In international timekeeping, a location's time zone is sometimes expressed as $\text{-5}$ hours relative
        to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). Explain what the negative sign indicates when describing the time difference.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The negative sign indicates that the city's time is 5 hours behind GMT (meaning it reaches a certain time
        5 hours later than GMT).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the reference point: GMT (0 hours).'
      - Recognize that positive hours indicate 'ahead' of GMT (eastward) and negative hours indicate 'behind' GMT (westward).
      - The value $\text{-5}$ hours means the time zone is 5 hours in the direction opposite to 'ahead'.

        negative integers. If a sign directs you to level $\text{-3}$, how should you describe your location?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The location is 3 levels below the ground floor.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the zero point: The ground floor.'
      - Understand that the negative integers represent levels in the direction opposite to the positive integers (which would
        be floors above ground).
      - Level $\text{-3}$ indicates a location 3 units down from the ground floor.

    preWrittenQuestions:
    - problemText: Plot the integer $-3$ on a horizontal number line that ranges from $-5$ to $5$. Describe the position relative
        to zero.
      avatarIntro: Learning how to plot integers correctly is fundamental. Remember, the negative sign tells you which direction
        to move from zero!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Mark a point 3 units to the left of zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the origin (0) on the number line.
      - Since the integer is $-3$ (negative), movement must be to the left of zero.
      - Count 3 units away from zero in the negative direction.
      - The position is 3 units to the left of 0.
      id: q2-1
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: On a horizontal number line, a point is located $8$ units to the right of the origin (zero). What integer
        does this point represent?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '8'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The origin is 0.
      - Movement to the right corresponds to positive integers.
      - The distance from zero is 8 units.
      - Therefore, the integer represented is $+8$ or $8$.
      id: q2-2
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Describe the location of the integer $12$ on a number line that spans from $-15$ to $15$. Mention its relation
        to $0$ and explain why it is placed far to the right.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $12$ is located $12$ units to the right of zero. It is placed far to the right because positive integers
        increase in value as you move right along the number line, and $12$ is a relatively large positive value within this
        range.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the distance and direction of $12$ from the origin (0). $12$ is positive, so it is 12 units to the right.
      - 'Recall the rule for number lines: values increase as you move from left to right.'
      - Since $12$ is a large positive number in the range $[-15, 15]$, it will be positioned far away from zero in the positive
        direction (to the right).
      id: q2-3
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: When plotting integers on a standard horizontal number line, what special role does the number $0$ play,
        and how does it relate to the order of positive and negative numbers?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Zero ($0$) is the origin or center point of the number line. It serves as the boundary, separating all
        positive numbers (which lie to its right) from all negative numbers (which lie to its left). Zero is neither positive
        nor negative.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the name given to the position of $0$ on the number line (the origin/center).
      - Explain how $0$ differentiates between positive and negative numbers (positive to the right, negative to the left).
      - State the nature of $0$ itself (neither positive nor negative).
      id: q2-4
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Consider a number line running from $-10$ to $10$. If an integer $X$ has an absolute value of $7$, and
        $X$ is located on the side of the negative integers, what is the value of $X$?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '-7'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Understand the term ''absolute value'': $|X|=7$ means $X$ is $7$ units away from zero.'
      - 'Identify the possible values for $X$ based on the absolute value: $X$ could be $7$ or $-7$.'
      - 'Use the second condition: $X$ is located on the side of the negative integers (to the left of zero).'
      - Therefore, the value of $X$ must be $-7$.

    - problemText: 'Which integer is greater: $-15$ or $-20$? Use the correct inequality symbol in your answer and explain
        your reasoning based on their position relative to zero.'
      avatarIntro: Comparing negative numbers can be tricky! Remember that on the number line, numbers increase as you move
        to the right, and the number closer to zero is greater.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer:
        speech.text: negative fifteen is greater than negative twenty
        display.content: $-15 > -20$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the two integers: $-15$ and $-20$. Both are negative.'
      - 'Recall the rule for comparing negative integers: the integer closer to zero is greater.'
      - Since 15 is smaller than 20, $-15$ is closer to zero than $-20$ is.
      - Therefore, $-15$ is greater than $-20$. The correct inequality is $-15 > -20$.

    - problemText: Compare the integers $8$ and $-12$ using the correct inequality symbol.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer:
        speech.text: eight is greater than negative twelve
        display.content: $8 > -12$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the two integers: $8$ (positive) and $-12$ (negative).'
      - Recall the rule that any positive number is always greater than any negative number.
      - Since $8$ is positive and $-12$ is negative, $8$ must be greater than $-12$.
      - The comparison is $8 > -12$ (or $-12 < 8$).
      id: q3-2
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: 'Determine if the following statement is True or False: $0 > -10$. Justify your answer.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer:
        speech.text: 'True'
        display.content: 'True'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze the statement: $0 > -10$. This asks if zero is greater than negative ten.'
      - On a standard number line, all negative numbers are located to the left of zero.
      - Since numbers increase as you move to the right, any number to the left of zero is less than zero.
      - Therefore, $0$ is greater than $-10$. The statement is True.
      id: q3-3
      questionGroup: q3
    - problemText: 'Which number is smaller: $10$ or $15$?'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer:
        speech.text: ten
        display.content: $10$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the two integers: $10$ and $15$. Both are positive.'
      - Since $10$ is located to the left of $15$ on the number line, $10$ has a smaller value.
      - Therefore, $10$ is the smaller number.

    - problemText: 'Fill in the blank with the appropriate symbol (< or >): $-12$ __ $-5$.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer:
        speech.text: negative twelve is less than negative five
        display.content: $<$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the integers: $-12$ and $-5$. Both are negative.'
      - To compare negative numbers, determine which is closer to zero. $-5$ is closer to zero than $-12$ is.
      - This means $-5$ has a greater value than $-12$.
      - Since $-12$ is less than $-5$, the appropriate symbol is the less than sign ($<$). Thus, $-12 < -5$.

        value in this set.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '-3'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The set of integers is $\{-15, -8, -20, -3, -12\}$.
      - The largest value in a set of negative integers is the number closest to zero.
      - Comparing the absolute values (15, 8, 20, 3, 12), the smallest absolute value corresponds to the largest number.
      - The smallest absolute value is 3, which corresponds to the integer -3.
      - Therefore, -3 is the largest value in the set.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 12, 8, 0, -3, -5, -10
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Descending order means arranging the numbers from largest to smallest.
      - 'Identify positive numbers: 12, 8. Order them: 12, 8.'
      - 'Identify zero: 0.'
      - 'Identify negative numbers: -5, -3, -10. Order them from largest (closest to zero) to smallest (furthest from zero):

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '-9'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The set of integers is $\{4, -6, 0, -2, 9, -9, 1\}$.
      - The smallest number will be the negative integer furthest to the left on the number line.
      - 'Compare the negative integers: -6, -2, -9.'
      - Since 9 is the largest absolute value among these negative numbers, -9 is the number furthest from zero in the negative

          secondNumber: -4
          showSteps: true
          highlightZeroPairs: true
      finalAnswer: A zero pair is a set containing exactly one positive disc (+1) and one negative disc (-1). When these two
        opposites are combined, they cancel each other out because their sum is zero. In the case of (+4) + (-4), four zero
        pairs are formed, and since each pair has a value of zero, the total result is zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define a zero pair: one positive disc and one negative disc.'
      - Explain that the value of any zero pair is 0.
      - Identify how many zero pairs are formed when combining 4 positive and 4 negative discs (4 pairs).
      - Conclude that since all discs form zero pairs, the remaining value is 0.

        discs as possible to form zero pairs, how many zero pairs will they create?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 7 zero pairs.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the number of positive discs (10) and negative discs (7).
      - Recall that the number of zero pairs formed is limited by the lesser quantity of discs.
      - Since there are only 7 negative discs, only 7 positive discs can pair up with them.
      - Therefore, 7 zero pairs are created.

      finalAnswer: 4 negative discs remain, representing a total value of -4.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Combine the 3 positive discs and 7 negative discs.
      - Identify the number of zero pairs that can be formed (3 zero pairs, since 3 is the lesser quantity).
      - Visualize or calculate the discs remaining after the 3 zero pairs are removed.
      - Since 7 - 3 = 4 negative discs remain, the final value is -4.

          highlightZeroPairs: true
      finalAnswer: The combination of 5 positive discs (+5) and 5 negative discs (-5) allows exactly 5 zero pairs to be formed.
        Since every disc is part of a zero pair, and each zero pair has a value of 0, the entire set cancels out, leaving
        a total value of 0.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Represent (+5) as 5 positive discs and (-5) as 5 negative discs.
      - Show that because the counts are equal, every positive disc can be paired with a negative disc.
      - Confirm that 5 zero pairs are formed.
      - Conclude that since zero pairs have a value of 0, the sum of (+5) and (-5) is 0.

      - A number is irrational if its decimal representation is non-terminating (goes on forever) AND non-repeating (has no

    - problemText: Explain the fundamental difference that makes $\sqrt{36}$ a rational number but $\sqrt{12}$ an irrational
        number.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\sqrt{36}$ is rational because 36 is a perfect square ($\sqrt{36}=6$, which is $6/1$). $\sqrt{12}$ is
        irrational because 12 is not a perfect square, resulting in a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Evaluate $\sqrt{36}$. Since $6 \times 6 = 36$, $\sqrt{36} = 6$. Since 6 can be written as $6/1$, it is rational.
      - Evaluate $\sqrt{12}$. Since 12 is not a perfect square, $\sqrt{12}$ results in a decimal that goes on forever without

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\sqrt{5}$ is the irrational number.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Calculate or simplify $\sqrt{25}$. Since $5 \times 5 = 25$, $\sqrt{25} = 5$. This is rational ($5/1$).
      - Analyze $\sqrt{5}$. Since 5 is not a perfect square, $\sqrt{5}$ cannot be simplified to an integer or a terminating/repeating
        decimal.
      - The decimal value of $\sqrt{5}$ (approximately 2.236...) is non-terminating and non-repeating.
      - Therefore, $\sqrt{5}$ is the irrational number because it cannot be written in the form $a/b$.

        in this fractional form?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It is impossible because $\sqrt{3}$ is an irrational number. Its decimal representation (approximately
        1.732...) is non-terminating AND non-repeating, which means it fundamentally violates the definition of a rational
        number.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of an irrational number: a number that cannot be written as a fraction $a/b$.'
      - Identify the nature of $\sqrt{3}$. Since 3 is not a perfect square, $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
      - Irrational numbers have decimal representations that are non-terminating and non-repeating.
      - Since $\sqrt{3}$ has a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal, there are no integers $a$ and $b$ that can form a fraction
        equal to $\sqrt{3}$.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Rational numbers and Irrational numbers are mutually exclusive sets; a number cannot be both. Together,
        they form the complete set of Real numbers (\u211d = \u211a \u222a Irrational).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Define Rational numbers (numbers expressible as a/b) and Irrational numbers (numbers not expressible as a/b).
      - Determine if they overlap. Since the definitions are mutually exclusive, they are disjoint sets.

      finalAnswer: False. Natural numbers (\u2115) are counting numbers starting at 1 ({1, 2, 3, ...}), whereas Whole numbers
        (W) include 0 ({0, 1, 2, 3, ...}). The element 0 is in W but not in \u2115, meaning W is not a subset of \u2115.

        explanation rather than just listing elements.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The statement $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$ means that the set of Integers (\u2124) is a subset of the
        set of Rational numbers (\u211a). Conceptually, this means that every single integer can be written in the form $a/b$,
        where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b \neq 0$. For example, the integer -3 can be written as $-3/1$.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the symbol \u2282 (subset) and its meaning: ''is contained within'' or ''is a subset of''.'
      - 'Identify the sets: \u2124 (Integers) and \u211a (Rational numbers).'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Whole numbers (W) include zero and all positive counting numbers. Integers (\u2124) include all Whole numbers
        AND incorporate the criterion of including all negative whole numbers (or opposites of the natural numbers). The key
        defining criterion for \u2124 is the inclusion of these negative values.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define Whole numbers (W): {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.'
      - 'Define Integers (\u2124): {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}.'
      - Compare the elements of the two sets.
      - The set of Integers includes all elements of Whole numbers but adds the requirement for negative values, which is
        the primary difference.

        speech: 'Calculate: one-fourth plus zero point five. Choose the conversion method that seems easiest for this problem.'
        display: 'Calculate: $\frac{1}{4} + 0.5$'
      avatarIntro: Let's practice solving problems that mix fractions and decimals. Remember to convert all numbers to the
        same form before calculating!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 3/4 or 0.75
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Choose a common format. Converting to decimals is straightforward here since $1/4 = 0.25$.'
      - 'Step 2: Convert the fraction to a decimal: $\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.'
      - 'Step 3: Perform the addition: $0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75$.'
      - 'Step 4: (Alternatively, convert to fractions: $0.5 = 1/2$. $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{4}
        = \frac{3}{4}$). The answer is $\frac{3}{4}$ or $0.75$.'

        speech: 'Calculate: one-half minus zero point two. Decide whether to use fractions or decimals for the calculation.'
        display: 'Calculate: $\frac{1}{2} - 0.2$'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 3/10 or 0.3
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Choose a common format. Converting to fractions is effective since $0.2 = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$.'
      - 'Step 2: Convert $0.2$ to a fraction: $\frac{1}{5}$.'
      - 'Step 3: Find the difference: $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{5}$. The common denominator is 10.'
      - 'Step 4: $\frac{5}{10} - \frac{2}{10} = \frac{3}{10}$. (Alternatively, $0.5 - 0.2 = 0.3$). The answer is $\frac{3}{10}$
        or $0.3$.'

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the operation needed: Addition (total amount spent).'
      - 'Step 2: Convert both amounts to the same form. Since this involves money, decimals are usually easiest: $\frac{3}{4}
        = 0.75$.'
      - 'Step 3: Add the amounts: $0.75 + 0.10 = 0.85$.'
      - 'Step 4: Leo spent $0.85.'

        speech: A piece of copper tubing measures four-fifths meters in length. If zero point four meters is cut off, what
          length remains?
        display: A piece of copper tubing measures $\frac{4}{5}$ meters in length. If $0.4$ meters is cut off, what length
          remains?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 2/5 meters or 0.4 meters
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the operation needed: Subtraction (length remaining).'
      - 'Step 2: Convert both measurements to the same form. Converting to fractions simplifies the calculation: $0.4 = \frac{4}{10}
        = \frac{2}{5}$.'
      - 'Step 3: Subtract the cut length from the original length: $\frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{5}$.'
      - 'Step 4: $\frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2}{5}$ meters. (Alternatively, $0.8 - 0.4 = 0.4$ meters).'

          title: Rounding 23,645 to Nearest 10
          caption: Numbers at or above the midpoint (5) round UP by convention
      finalAnswer: The two nearest multiples of 10 are 23,640 and 23,650. Since 23,645 is exactly the midpoint, the convention
        is to round UP to 23,650.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the place value required: nearest 10.'
      - 'Identify the two boundary multiples: 23,640 (lower) and 23,650 (upper).'
      - Identify the critical digit (the ones digit), which is 5.
      - Since 5 is the midpoint, the established convention is always to round up.
      - Therefore, 23,645 rounds to 23,650.

          title: Rounding to Nearest 100
          caption: Numbers below the midpoint (50) round DOWN
      finalAnswer: When rounding 1,832 to the nearest 100, we look at the tens digit (3). Since 3 is less than 5 (the midpoint),
        1,832 is visually closer to 1,800 than it is to 1,900 on a number line, so we round DOWN.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the place value required: nearest 100.'
      - Identify the critical digit (the tens digit), which is 3.
      - The midpoint between 1,800 and 1,900 is 1,850.
      - Since 1,832 is less than the midpoint 1,850, it falls into the 'rounds down' range.
      - Visualization on the number line confirms that the distance to 1,800 (32 units) is shorter than the distance to 1,900
        (68 units).

    - problemText: A census recorded the population of a large district as 891,234. If this figure is rounded to the nearest
        1,000, what are the two nearest multiples of 1,000 to this number? Which is 891,234 closer to?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The two nearest multiples of 1,000 are 891,000 and 892,000. The number 891,234 is closer to 891,000.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the target place value: nearest 1,000.'
      - 'Identify the two boundaries: The thousand that comes before 891,234 is 891,000. The thousand that comes after is
        892,000.'
      - Identify the critical digit (the hundreds digit), which is 2.
      - Since 2 is below the midpoint (5), the number rounds down.
      - Therefore, 891,234 is closer to 891,000.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: A warehouse inventory count shows 65,432 items in stock. If the management requires this count to be rounded
        to the nearest 10,000, which digit must you examine to determine the rounding direction? Is this digit above, below,
        or exactly at the midpoint (5)? How should you round 65,432?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: To round to the nearest 10,000, you must examine the thousands digit, which is 5. This digit is exactly
        at the midpoint. By convention, 65,432 rounds UP to 70,000.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the rounding target: nearest 10,000.'
      - 'Identify the critical digit position: one place to the right of the target (the thousands place).'
      - The thousands digit in 65,432 is 5.
      - Compare the critical digit (5) to the midpoint (5). It is exactly at the midpoint.
      - 'Apply the rounding convention: 5 or greater rounds up. The upper multiple of 10,000 is 70,000.'

    - problemText: A business is creating a monthly budget and must round all costs to the nearest $10. If an expense is $837,
        explain the fundamental trade-off between simplicity and accuracy that determines why this amount rounds to $840 instead
        of $830.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Rounding involves a trade-off where we sacrifice a small amount of accuracy for simplicity. The number
        $837 rounds to $840 because 7 is greater than the midpoint (5). This means $840 is the NEAREST multiple of $10 to
        the original value, making it the most accurate simple representation.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the target place value: nearest 10.'
      - Identify the critical digit (ones digit), which is 7.
      - The two nearest multiples of 10 are 830 and 840.
      - 'Calculate the distance: 837 is 7 units away from 830, and 3 units away from 840.'
      - Since the goal of rounding is to find the closest (nearest) value, 840 is chosen because it minimizes the loss of
        accuracy.

        kept the same (rounding down).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the digit in the hundredths place (the second decimal place) of 3.218. This digit is 1.
      - The hundredths digit (1) determines the rounding direction for the tenths place.
      - Since 1 is less than 5, we round down, meaning the tenths digit (2) remains unchanged.
      - The rounded weight is 3.2 kg.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The digit controlling the rounding decision is the hundredths digit, which is 6.
      - Since 6 is 5 or greater, we round up the tenths digit (9).
      - Rounding 9 up results in 10, carrying over 1 to the units place (5+1=6).
      - The result, showing exactly 1 decimal place, is 6.0 meters.

        why writing '12.0' is preferred over just writing '12'?
      finalAnswer: 12.0 seconds. Writing '12.0' is essential because it explicitly shows that the measurement has been rounded
        to the tenths place (1 decimal place), communicating the required level of precision.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Examine the hundredths digit in 12.03, which is 3.
      - Since 3 is less than 5, the tenths digit (0) remains the same.
      - The rounded time is 12.0 seconds.
      - The trailing zero is crucial because the instruction was to round to 1 d.p.; showing 12.0 confirms that the precision
        achieved is to the nearest tenth, whereas '12' implies precision only to the nearest whole number.

      - The trailing zeros are significant because they indicate the precision of the measurement. Writing 0.00 (2 d.p.) shows
        the measurement was accurate to the nearest hundredth (0.01), confirming that the value was measured and determined
        to be approximately zero, not simply unmeasured or unknown.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 7.042 mm
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - To round to 3 decimal places (d.p.), we must look at the fourth decimal place (ten-thousandths).
      - In 7.04152, the fourth decimal place is 5.

    preWrittenQuestions:
    - problemText: Explain the fundamental difference between a measurement having 4 decimal places and a measurement having
        4 significant figures. Are these terms interchangeable in engineering specifications?
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Understanding significant figures is crucial because they tell us how precise a measurement really
        is. Let's start with a key distinction.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, they are not interchangeable. 4 decimal places (d.p.) refers only to the number of digits appearing
        after the decimal point (e.g., 12.3456). 4 significant figures (s.f.) refers to the total number of meaningful digits
        in the entire number, regardless of where the decimal point falls (e.g., 0.005678 has 4 s.f. but 6 d.p.).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define Decimal Places: Decimal places count only the digits appearing to the right of the decimal marker.'
      - 'Define Significant Figures: Significant figures count all the meaningful, measured digits in a number, starting from
        the first non-zero digit.'
      - 'Contrast the Concepts: Use an example to show that the counts are often different. For example, 543.2 has 1 d.p.
        but 4 s.f. whereas 0.0005432 has 4 s.f. but 7 d.p.'

    - problemText: In a laboratory setting, a student records a mass as zero point zero zero zero seven zero grams (0.00070
        g). Why does this value convey more measurement precision than if they had simply recorded zero point zero zero zero
        seven grams (0.0007 g)?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The trailing zero in 0.00070 is significant because it is a zero that comes after a non-zero digit AND
        after the decimal point. This zero indicates that the instrument used was precise enough to measure the value exactly
        down to the hundred-thousandths place (0.00001 g). 0.0007 (1 s.f.) only guarantees precision down to the ten-thousandths
        place (0.0001 g). The extra significant zero demonstrates higher measurement accuracy.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the significant figures count for both: 0.00070 has 2 s.f.; 0.0007 has 1 s.f.'
      - 'Explain the role of the trailing zero: The trailing zero in 0.00070 is a measured digit, confirming that the value
        in that smallest place value column is zero, not just an estimate.'
      - 'Relate s.f. count to precision: A higher number of significant figures, especially those indicated by trailing zeros
        after a decimal point, communicates a more precise and reliable measurement.'

    - problemText: A manufacturing specification requires a cable length of 2000 meters. Without using scientific notation,
        does the number 2000 clearly indicate 1, 2, 3, or 4 significant figures? Explain why this ambiguity exists when dealing
        with large whole numbers.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The number 2000 is ambiguous. It could represent 1 significant figure (if the length was rounded to the
        nearest thousand), 2 significant figures (rounded to the nearest hundred), 3 significant figures (rounded to the nearest
        ten), or 4 significant figures (if the measurement was exactly 2000). The trailing zeros in a whole number without
        a decimal point act as placeholders and may or may not be measured digits, leading to uncertainty about precision.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the ambiguity: Trailing zeros in integers (like 2000) are placeholders and their significance is not explicitly
        defined.'
      - 'Provide scenarios: Explain that 2000 could represent a measurement precise to the thousands place (1 s.f.) or the
        ones place (4 s.f.).'
      - 'Conclude why this is problematic: This lack of clarity means the measurement precision is unknown, which is why scientists
        and engineers often use scientific notation (e.g., 2.00 x 10³ for 3 s.f.) to resolve such ambiguities.'

    - problemText: Significant figures are used to reflect the quality of a measurement. Explain the key conceptual difference
        between the terms 'accuracy' and 'precision' when discussing the quality of scientific measurements.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or accepted value. Precision refers to how close
        repeated measurements are to each other (reproducibility) OR the level of detail/specificity of a single measurement
        (which is indicated by the number of significant figures). Significant figures primarily communicate precision.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define Accuracy: Accuracy is about correctness—closeness to the target or true value.'
      - 'Define Precision: Precision is about consistency and detail—closeness of measurements to one another, or the resolution
        of the measuring instrument.'
      - 'Relate s.f.: Significant figures are a direct indicator of the precision of the measuring tool used.'

        reported 7.89 A.U., how would the communication about the reliability and precision of the survey data change?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The measurement 7.895 A.U. (4 significant figures) indicates a higher level of precision. It means the
        measurement instrument was precise enough to determine the distance to the thousandths place (±0.001 A.U.). By contrast,
        7.89 A.U. (3 significant figures) indicates precision only to the hundredths place (±0.01 A.U.). The additional significant
        figure in 7.895 communicates that the survey data is more refined and less estimated.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Count the s.f. for both values: 7.895 has 4 s.f.; 7.89 has 3 s.f.'
      - 'Identify the level of precision: 4 s.f. means precision to the nearest 0.001 unit; 3 s.f. means precision to the
        nearest 0.01 unit.'
      - 'Explain the communication difference: Because significant figures show the degree of certainty in a measurement,
        dropping a significant figure implies the measurement tool or process was less refined or the final digit was estimated/rounded,
        thus lowering the communicated precision.'

        figures using the relevant rules.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The number 0.000123 has 3 significant figures (1, 2, and 3). Rule 4 states that zeros BEFORE the first
        non-zero digit (leading zeros) are NOT significant. The '0.000' zeros are merely placeholders showing the decimal
        position and are therefore ignored. Only the non-zero digits 1, 2, and 3 count (Rule 1).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the first non-zero digit, which is 1.
      - 'Apply Rule 4: Zeros that come before the first non-zero digit are not significant. This means the four leading zeros
        (0.000) are not counted.'

      finalAnswer: Rule 1 (All non-zero digits are significant) and Rule 2 (All zeros BETWEEN non-zero digits are significant).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the non-zero digits: 7 and 6. Rule 1 confirms these are significant.'
      - 'Identify the zeros: There are five zeros between 7 and 6.'
      - 'Apply Rule 2: Zeros located between significant (non-zero) digits are always significant. Therefore, all five zeros

        The pressure reading (0.0456) has only 3 significant figures because Rule 4 dictates that leading zeros (zeros before

        the number of significant figures for this integer value according to Rule 3. Provide the scientific notation for
        30000 if it were known to have exactly 2 significant figures.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The number of significant figures is ambiguous (could be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). If it has 2 significant figures,
        the scientific notation is 3.0 × 10⁴.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Rule 3 applies to trailing zeros in integers without a written decimal point. These zeros (0000) may or may not be
        significant depending on whether the number is exact or was rounded.
      - If 30000 was rounded to the nearest ten thousand, it has 1 significant figure (3). If it was rounded to the nearest
        thousand, it has 2 significant figures (3 and 0). If it was an exact count, it has 5 significant figures.
      - Because the trailing zeros are context-dependent, the value is ambiguous (1 to 5 s.f.).
      - 'Scientific notation removes this ambiguity. To show exactly 2 significant figures (3 and 0), we write 3.0, and adjust
        the power of 10 to maintain the magnitude: 3.0 × 10⁴.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 5.00 m has 3 significant figures. 500 m is ambiguous, likely having 1 or 2 significant figures without
        context. The decimal point in 5.00 m invokes Rule 5, ensuring trailing zeros are significant.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze 5.00: This is a decimal number. Rule 5 states that zeros following a non-zero digit in a decimal ARE significant.
        Therefore, 5.00 has 3 significant figures (5, 0, 0). The trailing zeros show precision to the hundredths place.'
      - 'Analyze 500: This is an integer without a decimal point. Rule 3 states that trailing zeros may or may not be significant.
        Without context, we assume the least precision (1 s.f.), or we acknowledge the ambiguity (1, 2, or 3 s.f.).'

        (a) Round the side length ($\sqrt{2}$) to 2 significant figures (s.f.) first, then multiply by 4.

        (b) Use the full precision of your calculator for $\sqrt{2}$, and round only the final calculated perimeter to 3 s.f.'
      avatarIntro: Understanding how and when to round is crucial for accuracy. Let’s practice preventing follow-through errors
        in multi-step calculations.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (a) 5.6 m; (b) 5.66 m. Method (b) is more accurate because early rounding in (a) introduces a follow-through
        error.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the true value of the perimeter: $P = 4 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 5.65685$ m.'
      - 'Calculate method (a): $\sqrt{2}$ rounded to 2 s.f. is $1.4$. $P_a = 4 \times 1.4 = 5.6$ m.'

      - Compare the results. $5.66$ m is the correct answer to 3 s.f., showing that the early rounding in method (a) resulted
        in a less accurate value of $5.6$ m (a difference of approximately 0.06 m).

        what is the minimum number of significant figures you should keep during all intermediate calculation steps? Explain
        the mathematical reasoning for this rule.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Keep at least 3 significant figures (s.f.) during intermediate steps. This is based on the (n+1) rule.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the required precision for the final answer, $n=2$ s.f.
      - Apply the (n+1) rule, which states that intermediate calculations should retain at least $n+1$ significant figures.
        Therefore, $2+1=3$ s.f.
      - 'Explain the reasoning: Keeping one extra digit (the guard digit) minimizes the accumulation of rounding errors (follow-through

    - problemText: You are calculating the volume of a cylinder using the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where the dimensions lead
        to a final result of $5 \times \pi$. Explain why rounding the value of $\pi$ to $3.14$ before performing the multiplication
        step reduces the overall accuracy, even if the final answer is only required to 3 significant figures.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Rounding $\pi$ (an intermediate value) before multiplication introduces a systematic error of approximately
        0.00159 per unit of $\pi$. This error is carried forward (a follow-through error) and results in a less accurate final
        answer when compared to using full calculator precision until the final rounding step.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the true value (rounded to 3 s.f.): $5 \times \pi \approx 15.7079... \rightarrow 15.7$ (3 s.f.).'
      - 'Determine the result using the early rounded value: $5 \times 3.14 = 15.70$.'
      - 'Note that in this specific calculation, the results seem identical to 3 s.f. (15.7). However, explain the principle:
        Early rounding of $\pi$ (3.14) means losing the precision of the remaining digits (0.00159...).'
      - This loss of precision means that $15.70$ is the calculated value, whereas $15.7079...$ is the true value. While both
        round to $15.7$, the method using full precision ($15.7079...$) is mathematically closer to the truth, and in multi-step

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the exact value of $C$ using fractions: $C = \frac{10}{12} + \frac{3}{12} - \frac{4}{12} = \frac{9}{12}
        = 0.75$.'
      - 'Calculate (a) using full precision: $0.75$. Rounding to 4 s.f. gives $0.7500$.'

      - 'Sum the rounded values: $0.833 + 0.250 - 0.333 = 0.750$.'

    - problemText: You need to estimate the length of a long school corridor but have no measuring tape. Describe a practical
        method using your natural stride as a benchmark (assume an average adult stride is 70 cm). Explain the steps you would
        take.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: A practical method is to pace the corridor length, counting the number of strides taken. The total length
        is estimated by multiplying the counted number of strides by the average stride length (70 cm). For example, if you
        count 50 strides, the estimated length is 50 × 70 cm = 3500 cm, or 35 meters.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Select the appropriate benchmark: Stride (≈ 70 cm), as it is scaled appropriately for large distances like a corridor.'
      - Walk the length of the corridor using your normal stride, counting the total number of strides taken.
      - Multiply the total count of strides by the benchmark value (70 cm) to get the estimated length in centimeters.
      - Convert the final result to meters for a practical measurement (divide by 100).

    - problemText: A standard student desk is typically 60 to 80 cm long. Explain why using a cubit (elbow to fingertip, approximately
        45 cm) is a more appropriate benchmark than using hand width (approximately 10 cm) to estimate the desk's length.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The cubit (45 cm) is a more appropriate benchmark because its scale is comparable to the length of the
        desk (60-80 cm). This means the estimation would require only 1 to 2 cubits, making the process quick and minimizing
        counting errors. Using hand width (10 cm) would require counting 6 to 8 hand widths, which is more tedious and increases
        the likelihood of error, demonstrating that the cubit is scaled better for medium-sized measurements.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the measurement scale: The desk length is medium (60-80 cm).'
      - 'Analyze the benchmarks: Hand width (10 cm) is small; Cubit (45 cm) is medium.'
      - 'Determine the practicality: Using the cubit requires fewer repetitions (1-2 times), making it faster and more practical
        for this scale.'
      - 'Determine the impracticality: Using hand width requires many repetitions (6-8 times), increasing the time taken and
        potential estimation error.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 1.0 m
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the benchmark value: Forearm ≈ 25 cm.'
      - 'Identify the estimated count: The whiteboard is 4 forearms long.'
      - 'Calculate the estimated length in centimeters: 4 × 25 cm = 100 cm.'

    - problemText: The benchmark rule that 'a person's arm span is approximately equal to their height' is often used to estimate
        heights. Explain why this relationship provides only an approximate value and name one potential limitation of using
        this method to estimate the height of a specific person.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The value is approximate because while this relationship (often called the 'ape index') holds true on average
        across large populations, individual body proportions vary significantly. Not every person has an exact height-to-arm-span
        ratio of 1:1. A potential limitation is that the person being measured might have unusually long or short limbs, leading
        to a substantial error in the estimated height.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the reason for approximation: Benchmarks rely on averages and generalizations; individual body dimensions vary.'
      - 'Explain why the relationship is not exact: Biological variation means the 1:1 ratio (arm span to height) does not
        hold precisely for everyone.'
      - 'Identify a specific limitation: The estimation accuracy is compromised if the person being measured has body proportions
        that deviate significantly from the average (e.g., disproportionately long arms).'

        estimation based on rounding to 1 significant figure to check if this result is reasonable, ensuring you follow the
        correct order of operations.
      avatarIntro: It's important to catch calculator mistakes before relying on the final number. Let's practice using estimation
        as a reality check!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The result 3559.132 is highly unreasonable. The estimate is approximately 250.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Round the numbers in the expression: $125.8 \approx 130$, $3.91 \approx 4$, and $27.48 \approx 30$.'
      - 'Formulate the estimated expression: $130 + 4 \times 30$.'

      - 'Perform the addition: $130 + 120 = 250$.'
      - Compare the estimate (250) to the calculator result (3559.132). Since the calculator result is more than ten times
        larger than the estimate, it is highly unreasonable. The manager likely forgot the order of operations and added $125.8

      finalAnswer: The coordinates are (5, -4). The point lies in Quadrant IV.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Determine the coordinates of point P. Move 5 units right (positive x-direction) and 4 units down (negative
        y-direction). The coordinates are (5, -4).'
      - 'Step 2: Analyze the signs. The x-coordinate is positive (+) and the y-coordinate is negative (-).'
      - 'Step 3: Recall the quadrant rules: (+, +) is Q I, (-, +) is Q II, (-, -) is Q III, and (+, -) is Q IV. Since P is
        (+, -), it lies in Quadrant IV.'

            color: red
          caption: Points A and B plotted on the coordinate plane
      finalAnswer: No, they are different points. Order matters in ordered pairs; (1, 5) means 1 unit right and 5 units up,
        while (5, 1) means 5 units right and 1 unit up.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Locate Point A (1, 5). Start at the origin, move 1 unit along the x-axis, then 5 units up the y-axis.'
      - 'Step 2: Locate Point B (5, 1). Start at the origin, move 5 units along the x-axis, then 1 unit up the y-axis.'
      - 'Step 3: Compare the locations. Since the points occupy distinct positions and are plotted in different places, they
        are not the same. This illustrates that the order of coordinates (x, y) is critical.'

      finalAnswer: Point Z is located on the x-axis. Points that lie directly on the x-axis or the y-axis do not belong to
        any of the four quadrants.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Locate the point Z (−2, 0). This means moving 2 units left from the origin and 0 units vertically.'
      - 'Step 2: Recognize that the point lies directly on the horizontal axis (the x-axis).'

    - problemText: Plot the point A(−4, 5) on a coordinate plane. Write down the precise steps required to plot this point
        accurately, starting from the origin (0, 0).
      avatarIntro: 'Mastering the coordinate plane starts with knowing the rules! Remember: always move horizontally (x) before
        moving vertically (y).'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Plotting A(-4, 5) requires starting at (0, 0), moving 4 units left along the x-axis, and then 5 units up
        parallel to the y-axis. The point should be marked and labelled.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Start at the origin (0, 0).
      - Look at the x-coordinate, which is -4. Move 4 units to the left along the x-axis.
      - Look at the y-coordinate, which is 5. Move 5 units up, parallel to the y-axis.
      - Mark and label the final position as point A.

        the special location of point D.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Point B is 2 left, 5 up (Quadrant II); Point C is 4 right, 3 down (Quadrant IV); Point D lies directly
        on the y-axis, 2 units above the origin.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Plot B: Start at the origin, move 2 units left, then 5 units up.'
      - 'Plot C: Start at the origin, move 4 units right, then 3 units down.'
      - 'Plot D: Start at the origin, move 0 units horizontally, then 2 units up. Since the x-coordinate is zero, point D

    - problemText: A robot navigating a grid starts at the origin (0, 0). It is programmed to move 2 units left and then 5
        units down. What are the coordinates of the robot's final location?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (−2, −5)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Movement along the coordinate plane is represented by ordered pairs (x, y).
      - Movement left corresponds to a negative change in the x-coordinate. Moving 2 units left means x = −2.
      - Movement down corresponds to a negative change in the y-coordinate. Moving 5 units down means y = −5.
      - The final coordinates are (−2, −5).
      id: q2-3
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Describe the movement required, starting from the origin (0, 0), to accurately plot the point E(5, 0).
        Explain why only one movement direction is needed.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Start at (0, 0). Move 5 units right along the x-axis. No vertical movement is needed because the y-coordinate
        is zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the coordinates: x = 5 and y = 0.'
      - The x-coordinate (5, positive) dictates movement 5 units to the right.
      - The y-coordinate (0) dictates zero movement in the vertical direction (up or down).
      - The point E(5, 0) lies directly on the positive x-axis, requiring only horizontal movement.

      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Plot the point F(−3, −4). Explain the difference between plotting F(−3, −4) and plotting G(3, 4) in terms
        of the direction of movement from the origin.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: F(−3, −4) requires movement 3 units left (negative x) and 4 units down (negative y). G(3, 4) requires movement
        3 units right (positive x) and 4 units up (positive y). The directions are completely opposite.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'To plot F(−3, −4): Start at (0, 0), move 3 units left (negative x) and 4 units down (negative y).'
      - 'To plot G(3, 4): Start at (0, 0), move 3 units right (positive x) and 4 units up (positive y).'
      - The negative signs in F indicate movement in the negative directions (left and down), placing F in Quadrant III, while
        the positive signs in G indicate movement in the positive directions (right and up), placing G in Quadrant I.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Start at the origin (0, 0).
      - Move horizontally along the x-axis to align vertically with point A. This movement is 3 units to the right, so the
        x-coordinate is 3.
      - Move vertically along the y-axis (or trace from the x-position) to align horizontally with point A. This movement
        is 4 units up, so the y-coordinate is 4.

        a rule, and produces exactly one output.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '37'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Start with the given input, which is 6.'

        15), (6, 13). Explain your reasoning using the definition of a function.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, it is not a function because the input 4 maps to two different outputs (10 and 15).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Recall the definition of a function: Each input (x-value) must have exactly one output (y-value).'

        Book Number (ISBN). Does this relationship represent a function? Justify your answer based on the mathematical definition
        of a function.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, this represents a function. According to the definition, each input (book) must have exactly one output
        (ISBN). Since every book is assigned only one unique ISBN, the condition is satisfied.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Identify the input (the book) and the output (the ISBN).'
      - 'Step 2: Apply the function test: Check if it is possible for one specific input (one book) to have multiple different
        outputs (two different ISBNs).'

        start by identifying the key components of this equation.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, it is linear. m = 2, c = -1
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Compare the given equation $y = 2x - 1$ to the standard linear form $y = mx + c$.
      - Since the equation fits the form $y = mx + c$, it is a linear function.

        $h$ hours is given by the function $T = 20 - 2h$.


        What is the rate of change of the object’s temperature? Is the temperature increasing or decreasing?'
      mathTool:
        toolName: functionGraph
        parameters:
          expression: 20 - 2x
          xMin: 0
          xMax: 10
          yMin: 0
          yMax: 20
          label: T = 20 - 2h
          xLabel: Time (h)
          yLabel: Temperature (°C)
      finalAnswer: The rate of change is -2 °C per hour. Since the gradient is negative (-2), the temperature is decreasing.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the gradient (rate of change) from the equation $T = 20 - 2h$. The gradient $m$ is -2.
      - 'The rate of change is the absolute value of the gradient, coupled with the units: 2 °C per hour.'
      - Determine the direction of change. Since the gradient is negative ($m < 0$), the quantity (Temperature $T$) is decreasing.

    - problemText: 'During a sprint training session, the distance $s$ (in meters) an athlete covers is related to the time
        $t$ (in seconds) by the equation $s = 15t$.


        Calculate the gradient of this function. What physical quantity does this gradient represent, and what are its standard
        units?'
      mathTool:
        toolName: functionGraph
        parameters:
          expression: 15x
          xMin: 0
          xMax: 10

          label: s = 15t
          xLabel: Time (s)
          yLabel: Distance (m)
      finalAnswer: Gradient = 15. The gradient represents the athlete's speed (rate of change of distance). The units are
        meters per second (m/s).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the equation: $s = 15t$. This is in the form $y = mx + c$.'
      - The gradient $m$ is the coefficient of $t$, so $m = 15$.
      - The gradient represents the rate of change of $s$ (distance in meters) with respect to $t$ (time in seconds). This
        physical quantity is speed.
      - 'State the units: meters/second (m/s).'

    - problemText: 'A local delivery service charges a fixed booking fee plus a variable charge based on distance. The total
        cost $C$ (in dollars) for a delivery over a distance $d$ (in km) is $C = 5 + 2d$.


        If the delivery distance increases by 4 km, how much does the total cost increase? Explain how the gradient helps
        determine this increase.'
      mathTool:
        toolName: functionGraph
        parameters:
          expression: 5 + 2x
          xMin: 0
          xMax: 10
          yMin: 0
          yMax: 25
          label: C = 5 + 2d
          xLabel: Distance (km)
          yLabel: Total Cost ($)
      finalAnswer: The gradient of the function is $m = 2, which means the cost increases by $2 for every 1 km increase in
        distance. Therefore, if the distance increases by 4 km, the total cost increases by $2 \times 4 = $8.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the gradient $m$ from the equation $C = 5 + 2d$. The gradient is $m = 2$.
      - "The gradient represents the rate of change of cost ($) per unit of distance (km). $m = 2 \text{ dollars/km}$."
      - 'Calculate the cost increase: Change in Cost = Gradient $\times$ Change in Distance.'
      - 'Substitute the values: Increase = $2/km \times 4 km = $8.'
      - The gradient provides the constant multiplier needed to find the change in $C$ based on the change in $d$.

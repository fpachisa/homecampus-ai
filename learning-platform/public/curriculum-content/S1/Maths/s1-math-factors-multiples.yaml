        by 2, 3, 4, and so on.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Start by listing factor pairs systematically:'
      - 1 and 64 (1 × 64 = 64)
      - '64 is even, so 2 is a factor: 2 and 32 (2 × 32 = 64)'
      - 64 is not divisible by 3 (6 + 4 = 10)
      - '4 is a factor: 4 and 16 (4 × 16 = 64)'
      - 64 is not divisible by 5 or 6 or 7.

    - problemText: How many total factors does the number 120 have?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 16 factors
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Use the factor pair method to find all factors of 120:'
      - 1 × 120, 2 × 60, 3 × 40, 4 × 30, 5 × 24, 6 × 20, 8 × 15, 10 × 12.
      - Since 10 and 12 are consecutive factors, all pairs have been found.
      - 'List all the unique factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.'

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Is 12 a factor of 90? Explain your reasoning using the concept of exact division (no remainder).
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, 12 is not a factor of 90 because the division results in a remainder.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall that a factor must divide the number exactly.
      - 'Perform the division: 90 ÷ 12.'
      - 12 × 7 = 84, and 12 × 8 = 96.
      - Since 90 ÷ 12 = 7 with a remainder of 6 (90 - 84 = 6), the division is not exact.
      - Therefore, 12 is not a factor of 90.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (1, 35) and (5, 7)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Start with 1 and the number itself: (1, 35).'
      - 'Check 2: 35 is odd, so 2 is not a factor.'
      - 'Check 3: The sum of digits (3 + 5 = 8) is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a factor.'
      - 'Check 4: 35 is not divisible by 4.'
      - 'Check 5: 35 ends in 5, so 5 is a factor. 5 × 7 = 35. The pair is (5, 7).'
      - 'Check 6: 35 is not divisible by 6.'
      - 'Check 7: 7 is already listed. Stop here.'
      - The complete set of factor pairs is (1, 35) and (5, 7).

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 3 and 18
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Check 3: 7 + 2 = 9. Since 9 is divisible by 3, 72 is divisible by 3 (72 ÷ 3 = 24). (3 is a factor).'
      - 'Check 5: 72 does not end in 0 or 5. (5 is not a factor).'
      - 'Check 14: 72 ÷ 14 = 5 R 2. The division is not exact. (14 is not a factor).'
      - 'Check 18: 18 × 4 = 72. (18 is a factor).'
      - 'Check 40: 72 is less than 40 × 2 (80). 72 ÷ 40 = 1 R 32. (40 is not a factor).'
      - The factors of 72 from the list are 3 and 18.

    - problemText: List the first 6 multiples of 12.
      avatarIntro: Understanding multiples is fundamental to number theory. Remember, a multiple is the result of multiplying
        a number by a whole number, starting with 1.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72
      stepByStepGuideline:

    - problemText: Is 180 a multiple of 15? Explain your reasoning using the concept of exact division.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, 180 is a multiple of 15 because 180 ÷ 15 = 12, which is a whole number (no remainder).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - To determine if 180 is a multiple of 15, we must check if 180 is exactly divisible by 15.
      - 'Perform the division: 180 ÷ 15.'
      - The result is 12.
      - Since the result is a whole number (12) with zero remainder, 180 is a multiple of 15.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 24, 48, 56, 72, 88
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Check each number in the list to see if it can be divided exactly by 8.
      - 24 ÷ 8 = 3 (Multiple)
      - 34 ÷ 8 = 4 remainder 2 (Not a multiple)
      - 48 ÷ 8 = 6 (Multiple)
      - 56 ÷ 8 = 7 (Multiple)
      - 60 ÷ 8 = 7 remainder 4 (Not a multiple)
      - 72 ÷ 8 = 9 (Multiple)

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '65'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The nth multiple of a number (n) is found by calculating n multiplied by the ordinal position.
      - We need the 5th multiple of 13.
      - 'Calculate: 13 × 5.'
      - 13 × 5 = 65.

    - problemText: Find the smallest multiple of 6 that is greater than 100.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: '102'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'First, divide 100 by 6 to see how far 100 is from the nearest multiple: 100 ÷ 6 = 16 with a remainder of 4.'
      - This means 16 × 6 = 96 is the largest multiple less than 100.
      - To find the smallest multiple greater than 100, we must find the 17th multiple of 6.
      - 'Calculate: 17 × 6.'
      - 17 × 6 = 102.

      finalAnswer: 780 is divisible by 5 (ends in 0). 780 is also divisible by 10 (ends in 0).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Test for divisibility by 5: The number 780 ends in 0. Since 0 is allowed by the rule (ends in 0 or 5), 780 is divisible
        by 5.'
      - 'Test for divisibility by 10: The number 780 ends in 0. Since the rule requires the last digit to be 0, 780 is divisible

    - problemText: Explain why the number 2 is the only even number that is considered PRIME. Your explanation must reference
        the definition of a composite number.
      avatarIntro: Understanding the difference between PRIME and com-POZ-it numbers is crucial. Let's start by focusing on
        the number two.
      mathTool: {}
      finalAnswer: '2 is prime because it has exactly two factors (1 and 2). All other even numbers are greater than 2, and
        by definition, every number greater than 2 that is even must be divisible by 2. This means any even number $N > 2$
        has at least three distinct factors: 1, $N$, and 2. Since composite numbers are defined as having more than two factors,
        all even numbers greater than 2 are composite.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - State the definition of a prime number (exactly 2 factors).
      - Identify the factors of 2 (1 and 2). Conclude 2 is prime.
      - 'Explain the property of all even numbers greater than 2: they are divisible by 1, themselves, and 2.'
      - Conclude that having 3 or more factors means all even numbers greater than 2 meet the definition of a composite number.

    - problemText: Determine whether the number 39 is a PRIME or a com-POZ-it number. You must list all factors of 39 to justify
        your conclusion.
      mathTool: {}
      finalAnswer: 39 is a composite number. The factors of 39 are 1, 3, 13, and 39. Since 39 has four factors (more than
        two), it is classified as composite.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definitions: Prime numbers have exactly 2 factors; Composite numbers have more than 2 factors.'
      - Systematically find all numbers that divide 39 exactly.
      - 'List the factors: 1, 3, 13, 39.'

        without cutting any tiles. What is the side length of the square tiles she should use?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 12 cm
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the dimensions of the rectangular area: 60 cm and 84 cm.'
      - To tile the area using the 'largest possible square tiles' without cutting means the side length of the square tile
        must divide both the length and width exactly. This is the Highest Common Factor (HCF).
      - 'Calculate HCF(60, 84). Using prime factorization: 60 = 2² × 3 × 5, 84 = 2² × 3 × 7. HCF = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12.'

      finalAnswer: 9 units
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Finding the side length of a square from its area requires calculating the square root of the area.
      - We need to find a number, $n$, such that $n^2 = 81$.
      - 'Recall the perfect squares: $9 \times 9 = 81$.'

      - The square of 9 is $9^2 = 81$.
      - The square of 10 is $10^2 = 100$.
      - Since 99 falls between 81 and 100, and there is no integer whose square is 99, it is not a perfect square.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The volume (V) of a cube is calculated using the formula V = s³, where s is the side length.

      - The cube root of a negative number is always negative.

      finalAnswer: No, 200 is not a perfect cube. 5³ = 125 and 6³ = 216, so 200 lies between two consecutive perfect cubes.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - A perfect cube is a number that is the result of cubing an integer (n³).
      - Check the cubes of integers near 200.
      - 'Calculate 5³: 5 × 5 × 5 = 125.'
      - 'Calculate 6³: 6 × 6 × 6 = 216.'
      - Since 200 is greater than 125 but less than 216, it is not the cube of an integer. Therefore, 200 is not a perfect

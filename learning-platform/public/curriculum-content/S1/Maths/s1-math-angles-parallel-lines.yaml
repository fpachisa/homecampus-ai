    - problemText: 'Classify the following angle measurement: 60°'
      avatarIntro: Understanding angle classification is fundamental in geometry. Let's start by identifying the type of angle
        based on its measure.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Acute angle (because 0° < 60° < 90°)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the definitions for angle types based on their measure.
      - An acute angle measures between 0° and 90°.
      - Since 60° is greater than 0° but less than 90°, it is an acute angle.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: What type of angle is exactly 90°?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Right angle (because θ = 90°)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the angle measure given, which is 90°.
      - Recall that an angle measuring exactly 90° is defined as a right angle.
      - The classification is Right angle.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: If ∠ABC = 135°, what type of angle is it?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Obtuse angle (because 90° < 135° < 180°)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The given angle measure is 135°.
      - An obtuse angle measures between 90° and 180°.
      - Since 135° falls within this range (it is greater than 90° but less than 180°), it is an obtuse angle.
      id: q1-3
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Classify the angle measuring 180°.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Straight angle (because θ = 180°)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The angle measure is 180°.
      - Recall that an angle measuring exactly 180° forms a straight line.
      - Therefore, it is classified as a straight angle.
      id: q1-4
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: What type of angle is 300°?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Reflex angle (because 180° < 300° < 360°)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The given angle measure is 300°.
      - A reflex angle measures between 180° and 360°.
      - Since 300° is greater than 180° but less than 360°, it is classified as a reflex angle.

    - problemText: In the angle notation $\angle RSQ$, which letter represents the vertex of the angle?
      avatarIntro: Understanding angle notation is key to geometry! Remember that the vertex always has a special place in
        the naming convention.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: S
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the standard three-point notation for angles: $\angle ABC$.'
      - The middle letter (B) always identifies the vertex of the angle.
      - In the notation $\angle RSQ$, the middle letter is S.
      - Therefore, S represents the vertex.

    - problemText: Write the two correct standard notations for the angle at vertex N formed by rays NA and NT.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $\angle ANT$ or $\angle TNA$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the vertex, which is N.
      - In standard angle notation, the vertex must always be the middle letter.
      - 'The two possible correct notations are formed by placing N in the middle and using A and T as the outer points: $\angle
        ANT$ and $\angle TNA$.'

    - problemText: An angle has its vertex at point D, and its sides pass through points C and E. Is $\angle CDE$ a correct
        way to denote this angle? Explain your reasoning.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the location of the vertex. The problem states the vertex is at D.
      - 'Examine the given notation: $\angle CDE$.'
      - Check if the vertex D is in the middle position.
      - Since D is the middle letter, the notation $\angle CDE$ is correct because the vertex must always be specified by
        the central letter in the three-point notation.
      id: q2-3
      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: Identify the vertex in the angle denoted as $\angle M P L$.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: P
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The three-point notation for an angle places the vertex in the middle position.
      - In $\angle M P L$, the letter in the middle is P.
      - Therefore, P is the vertex of the angle.

    - problemText: A student writes $\angle FGX$ to denote the angle whose vertex is at point X, formed by rays XF and XG.
        Is this notation correct? Explain why or why not.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the specified vertex, which is X.
      - Recall that the vertex must always be the middle letter in the angle notation.
      - Examine the student's notation $\angle FGX$. In this notation, G is the middle letter, implying the vertex is G.
      - Since the required vertex X is not the middle letter, the notation $\angle FGX$ is incorrect. The correct notations
        would be $\angle FXG$ or $\angle GXF$.

    - problemText: When a weather report states the "average temperature" for the week was 22°C, this single value is summarizing
        many daily temperatures. What statistical concept is this 'average' attempting to measure, and why is it useful to
        have a single figure that acts as a "Representative value"?
      avatarIntro: This is a great chance to review the basic definition of an average. Remember, statistics often tries to
        simplify large amounts of data into a single, meaningful number.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The average is measuring the 'Central tendency' of the data. It is useful because it provides a single,
        typical value that summarizes the entire distribution, making it easier to compare different datasets or understand
        the overall condition.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the purpose of summarizing a large dataset (like all daily temperatures) into one number (the average).
      - Recall the statistical term used to describe where the data points tend to cluster (Central tendency or Measure of
        centre).
      - Explain that this single value acts as a representative statistic, allowing for quick comprehension of the entire
        data set.
      id: q1-1
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Explain the fundamental idea behind why an average is often called a "Measure of centre." What does the
        calculated average value tell us about the location of the rest of the data points?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: An average is called a 'Measure of centre' because it identifies the location in the distribution around
        which most of the data is gathered or balanced. It provides the typical location for a data point, indicating where
        the 'middle' of the dataset lies.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Define what 'centre' implies in a statistical distribution.
      - Relate the concept of the average back to the clustering or balancing of the data points.
      - Conclude that the average value indicates the typical location of the data.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: 'Statisticians use three primary types of averages: the Mean, the Median, and the Mode. Why is it crucial
        to have these three distinct methods for finding a "Typical value," instead of relying on just one calculation?'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: It is crucial because different types of averages measure different aspects of the data and are affected
        differently by the data's structure. For example, the Mean is sensitive to extreme outliers, while the Median is not.
        Using all three allows statisticians to select the most appropriate 'Typical value' based on the specific context
        and distribution of the dataset.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'List the three types of averages: Mean, Median, and Mode.'
      - Consider the main difference between these types (e.g., calculation method, sensitivity to outliers).
      - Explain that having three options allows the statistician to choose the one that most accurately reflects the 'typical'
        nature of the data, depending on its spread or skew.
      id: q1-3
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: 'Match the following definitions to the correct statistical term (Mean, Median, or Mode):


        (1) The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

        (2) The arithmetic average, calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.

        (3) The middle value when the data points are arranged in ascending order.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (1) Mode, (2) Mean, (3) Median.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Review the definition associated with the 'most frequent' value.
      - Review the definition associated with the 'arithmetic average' or 'balance point'.
      - Review the definition associated with the 'middle value' in an ordered list.

    - problemText: The average household size in a certain city is reported as 3.2 people. Explain why this single number,
        3.2, is considered a representative measure of central tendency for the entire population, even though it is impossible
        for any single household to have exactly 3.2 people.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The number 3.2 acts as a Representative value because it summarizes the complex distribution of all household
        sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) into a single figure. It represents the calculated balance point or expected value for the
        dataset, allowing for easy comparison with other cities or tracking changes over time, thus capturing the central
        trend of the data.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Acknowledge that an average is a theoretical value that summarizes many discrete inputs.
      - Explain that the purpose of the average is not to describe a single data point, but to describe the overall centre
        of the entire dataset.
      - State that this single value (3.2) provides a succinct summary (central tendency) of the population structure.

    preWrittenQuestions:
    - problemText: A survey of 10 houses sold in a luxury neighborhood shows that most prices cluster around $300,000. However,
        two sales were extremely large mansions priced at $5 million each. If a realtor reports the Mean house price, why
        might potential buyers interested in typical homes feel misled? Which average (Mean, Median, or Mode) would provide
        a more realistic representation of the typical house price in that neighborhood?
      avatarIntro: Choosing the right average is essential for fair representation. Let's explore situations where extreme
        values can be misleading!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The Mean house price would be heavily inflated by the two extremely high mansion prices ($5 million each).
        This high Mean would suggest houses are generally much more expensive than they typically are in that neighborhood,
        misleading buyers looking at standard homes. The Median would provide a more realistic representation because it only
        relies on the position of the middle value and is not affected by extreme outliers.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the extreme values (outliers) in the dataset (the two $5 million mansions).
      - Explain how these outliers affect the calculation of the Mean (they pull the Mean upwards, skewing the result).
      - Determine which measure of central tendency is resistant to outliers (the Median).
      - Conclude that the Median is the better measure because it accurately reflects the central or typical value when extreme
        values are present.

      questionGroup: q2
    - problemText: A major shoe store collects data on all shoe sizes sold last month. The manager needs to decide which size
        to order the largest quantity of for the next shipment to maximize sales. The sales data is non-numerical (e.g., Size
        6, Size 7, Size 8, Size 9, etc.). Which type of average (Mean, Median, or Mode) must the manager use for this inventory
        decision, and explain why the other two averages are unsuitable.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The manager must use the Mode. The Mode identifies the value that occurs most frequently (the most popular
        size). This is essential for inventory management to ensure the store stocks enough of the best-selling item. The
        Mean and Median are unsuitable because shoe sizes are often categorical (though they use numbers) and calculating
        an arithmetic average (Mean) or a middle position (Median) would likely result in a fractional or non-existent size
        that cannot be ordered.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the goal: finding the most popular item (highest frequency).'
      - Recall the definition of the Mode (most frequent value).
      - 'Explain why Mean and Median are inappropriate: Mean requires addition/division and the result might not be a valid
        shoe size. Median simply finds the middle value, which might not be the size they sell the most of.'

    - problemText: 'A small group of seven students reports the number of hours they spent studying last week: 4, 5, 5, 6,
        6, 6, and one highly motivated student who studied 40 hours. If the group reports their ''average'' study time using
        the Mean, what specific consequence does the 40-hour outlier have on the reported average, and why would the Median
        be a more honest indicator of the typical student''s effort?'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The 40-hour outlier drastically inflates the Mean study time. Calculating the Mean would suggest that the
        typical student studied much longer than they actually did (the Mean would be around 9.7 hours). This misrepresents
        the effort of the majority of the students. The Median study time is 6 hours, which is a much more accurate representation
        of the effort put in by the typical student because the Median is not affected by extreme values.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the outlier (40 hours).
      - Describe the effect of the outlier on the Mean (pulls it away from the cluster of data).
      - Determine the Median value (6 hours).
      - 'Explain why the Median is better: it represents the center of the data without being distorted by the single extreme
        value.'

    - problemText: A factory produces 5,000 light bulbs. They are interested in the bulbs’ lifespan to calculate warranty
        costs and overall expected energy savings for their customers. They measure the lifespan of a sample batch. While
        the Median lifespan might tell them the lifetime of the middle bulb, why is the Mean lifespan the most crucial measure
        for calculating the *total* expected operating hours of all 5,000 bulbs combined?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The Mean is directly related to the sum of all data points. By definition, the Mean is the total sum divided
        by the count. Therefore, if the factory knows the Mean lifespan of the sample, they can multiply that Mean by the
        total number of bulbs (5,000) to quickly estimate the aggregate total operating hours for the entire batch. This total
        sum is necessary for accurate financial planning, warranty projections, and customer benefit calculations. Neither
        the Median nor the Mode provides a direct mathematical link to the sum of the data.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the mathematical relationship of the Mean: Mean = Sum / Count.'
      - Explain that this relationship allows them to calculate the total sum (Total Hours = Mean * 5,000).
      - Justify why the total sum is necessary (warranty costs, energy savings, financial projection).
      - Conclude that the Mean is the only measure that enables this necessary calculation.

    - problemText: A film studio holds a focus group to discuss a new movie trailer aimed at young adults (ages 18-30). The
        participants consist of five young adults (ages 20, 22, 24, 25, 29) and one senior film critic aged 78. If the studio
        reports the Mean age of the focus group to advertisers, how does this misrepresent the intended target audience, and
        which measure of central tendency should they use instead?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The 78-year-old critic is an outlier that significantly increases the Mean age of the group. The Mean would
        suggest the typical participant is older than the intended 18-30 demographic. This misrepresents the composition of
        the group to advertisers. The Median (24.5 years) is a much better measure, as it accurately reflects the center of
        the primary target group without being skewed by the single older participant.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the data cluster (20-29) and the outlier (78).
      - Explain that the Mean is pulled towards the outlier, moving it out of the target demographic range.
      - Identify the Median as the middle value that is resistant to the outlier.
      - Conclude that the Median provides a more accurate representation of the typical age of the target audience.

    - problemText: Four students in a reading group, Alice, Ben, Chloe, and David, have 2, 5, 8, and 9 books respectively.
        The mean number of books is 6. Explain the concept of 'leveling out' these values using the mean. Specifically, what
        happens to the total number of books when the distribution is 'evened out'?
      avatarIntro: This problem asks you to visualize the mean as a fair share. Think about how the total value stays the
        same even when the distribution changes.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The mean of 6 represents the value each student would have if the books were redistributed equally. The
        total number of books (2 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 24) must remain the same, because 4 students multiplied by the mean (4 × 6)
        equals 24. 'Leveling out' means taking the excess books from those above the mean (Chloe and David) and giving them
        to those below the mean (Alice and Ben) until everyone holds exactly 6 books.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the total amount before leveling: 2 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 24 books.'
      - 'Identify the mean value: 6 books.'
      - 'Explain the concept of ''leveling out'': This means redistributing the total books so that every student receives
        the same amount, which is the mean (6 books).'
      - 'State the relationship between the mean and the total: The total number of books must remain 24 (4 students × 6 books/student)
        because the mean simply reallocates the existing total, it does not change the overall quantity.'

    - problemText: A group of five friends calculated that the mean number of sweets they had was 12. Vani had 7 sweets originally,
        while others had varying amounts. If they decide to 'even out' their sweets based on the mean, what does the mean
        represent in terms of fair distribution, and why is the total number of sweets unchanged?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The mean of 12 represents the 'fair share' or the amount each of the five friends would receive if the
        total quantity of sweets was pooled together and divided equally. The total number of sweets remains unchanged because
        the process of calculating the mean involves summing the original amounts and then dividing by the count (5). Redistributing
        the total (5 × 12 = 60 sweets) equally ensures the total quantity is conserved, even though Vani now receives 5 more
        sweets (12 instead of 7).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the mean in the context of sharing: The mean (12 sweets) is the equal share that every person would get.'
      - 'Calculate the total number of sweets: 5 friends × 12 sweets = 60 sweets.'
      - 'Explain why the total is unchanged: The mean is derived directly from the original total amount. Leveling out the
        amounts is just a redistribution of the fixed total (60 sweets), hence the total must remain constant.'

    - problemText: A factory employs six workers whose daily wages vary significantly. If the mean daily wage is calculated
        to be $85, explain what this mean value represents in terms of equal distribution and the factory's total daily payroll.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The mean daily wage of $85 represents the amount each of the six workers would earn if the factory decided
        to divide its total daily payroll equally among all employees. This means that if every worker earned exactly $85,
        the factory's total payroll (6 workers × $85 = $510) would be identical to the total amount originally paid out when
        the wages were uneven.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the mean wage: $85.'
      - 'Explain the ''equal distribution'': If wages were ''leveled out'', $85 is the wage every worker would receive.'
      - 'Connect the mean to the total payroll: The mean ensures that the total factory expenditure (Total Payroll) is preserved.
        The total payroll is the mean multiplied by the number of workers (6 × $85).'

    - problemText: Three sports classes received 10, 14, and 18 basketballs, respectively. The sports director calculates
        the mean number of basketballs per class as 14. Describe the physical process of 'leveling out' the distribution of
        basketballs to match the mean value (14), and explain why this demonstrates the concept of the mean.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: To 'level out' the distribution to the mean (14), we must move items from those above the mean to those
        below the mean. The class with 18 basketballs has 4 excess (18 - 14 = 4). The class with 10 basketballs needs 4 more
        (14 - 10 = 4). By physically taking the 4 excess basketballs from the class with 18 and giving them to the class with
        10, all three classes end up with 14 basketballs. This demonstrates the mean because it visually confirms that the
        mean acts as the balance point, where the total deficit (4) equals the total surplus (4).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the mean: 14 basketballs.'
      - 'Calculate the surplus/deficit: Class 1 (10) needs 4. Class 3 (18) has 4 excess. Class 2 (14) is balanced.'
      - 'Describe the leveling action: Take the surplus (4) from Class 3 and give it to the deficit (Class 1).'
      - 'Explain the result: All classes now have 14. This process shows that the mean is the value reached when the total
        quantity is equally distributed.'

    - problemText: A marathon team consists of four runners with individual running times of 150 minutes, 160 minutes, 170
        minutes, and 180 minutes. The mean running time is 165 minutes. If we state that 165 minutes 'levels out' the performance,
        what does this imply about the team's total effort, and why is this concept useful for evaluating team performance?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: If 165 minutes 'levels out' the performance, it implies that if every runner had contributed exactly 165
        minutes, the team's total running time (4 runners × 165 minutes = 660 minutes) would be exactly the same as the actual
        total time (150 + 160 + 170 + 180 = 660 minutes). This concept is useful because the mean provides a single, fair
        measure of central tendency, allowing the coach to evaluate the team's overall collective effort without being misled
        by individual variations.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the total effort (time): 150 + 160 + 170 + 180 = 660 minutes.'
      - 'Explain ''leveling out'' the performance: If everyone ran the mean time (165 minutes), the new total time would be
        4 × 165 = 660 minutes.'
      - 'Conclusion on total effort: This proves that the mean preserves the total collective effort, representing what everyone
        would achieve if they contributed equally.'
      - 'Explain usefulness: The mean simplifies complex data into a single representative figure for easy evaluation and
        comparison.'

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The overall mean score is 76 marks.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Explain the error: Simply averaging the means (75) is incorrect because the groups (bases) are of different sizes

        salary of $3000. Determine the overall mean monthly salary for all 20 employees. Justify why the overall mean is not
        $2500.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The overall mean monthly salary is $2250.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Averaging the means ($2500) is incorrect because the bases (15 employees vs 5 employees) are unequal. The larger group
        (Junior staff) pulls the overall mean closer to its salary ($2000).
      - 'Calculate the total salary paid to Junior staff: Total Salary A = 15 × $2000 = $30,000.'
      - 'Calculate the total salary paid to Senior staff: Total Salary B = 5 × $3000 = $15,000.'

        time of 60 minutes. Calculate the weighted mean finishing time for all 35 runners. Explain why the simple average
        of the times would overestimate the true mean.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The weighted mean finishing time is approximately 49.29 minutes (or 49 and 4/7 minutes).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The simple average ((45+60)/2 = 52.5 minutes) would be incorrect because it fails to account for the base sizes (25
        runners in Group X vs 10 runners in Group Y). Since the faster group (Group X, 45 min) is much larger, the true overall
        mean must be closer to 45 minutes, meaning the simple average overestimates the time.
      - 'Calculate the total running time for Group X: Total Time X = 25 runners × 45 minutes = 1125 minutes.'
      - 'Calculate the total running time for Group Y: Total Time Y = 10 runners × 60 minutes = 600 minutes.'
      - 'Calculate the overall total time and total number of runners: Overall Total Time = 1125 + 600 = 1725 minutes. Total
        Runners = 25 + 10 = 35.'

        Batch 1 consisted of 100 units and had a mean defect rate of 3%. Batch 2 consisted of 400 units and had a mean defect
        rate of 1%. Calculate the overall mean defect rate for the combined 500 units. Why is calculating (3% + 1%) / 2 an
        inappropriate method here?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The overall mean defect rate is 1.4%.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The simple average (2%) is inappropriate because the bases (100 units vs 400 units) are highly unequal. Batch 2, which
        has a much lower defect rate (1%) and is four times larger, heavily influences the overall result, pulling the combined
        rate down significantly.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The overall mean profit per item is $44.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The overall mean is closer to $40 because Store Q (mean $40) sold 18 items, which is a larger base (weight) than the
        12 items sold by Store P (mean $50). The larger sales volume at Store Q pulls the combined average toward its mean

      - 'Sort the known six values: 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15.'
      - Since the median must be 10, the 4th value in the list of seven must be 10.
      - If we insert x, we need the first three values to be ≤ 10 and the last three values to be ≥ 10.
      - The known values surrounding the 4th position are 8 (3rd position) and 10 (4th position).
      - If x is placed after 10 (e.g., x=11), the order is 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15. The 4th value is 10. This works.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the total number of data points (N). N = 7 + 1 = 8 (Even).
      - Calculate the position of the median. The median is the mean of the N/2 and (N/2 + 1) values, which are the 4th and
        5th values.
      - Since the median is 5.4 g, the sum of the 4th and 5th values must be 5.4 × 2 = 10.8.
      - 'Sort the known seven values: 3.5, 4.2, 4.8, 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 7.1.'
      - We need to insert x such that the 4th value (V4) and 5th value (V5) sum to 10.8.
      - 'If x is inserted between 5.0 (the known 4th value) and 6.0 (the known 5th value): V4 remains 5.0, and V5 becomes

        of $x$.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 145 (or any value x such that 130 ≤ x ≤ 150)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Determine the total number of data points (N). N = 5 + 1 = 6 (Even).
      - The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values (V3 and V4).
      - Since the median is 140, V3 + V4 = 140 × 2 = 280.
      - 'Sort the known five values: 100, 120, 130, 150, 180.'
      - The current middle values are 130 (3rd) and 150 (4th). Their sum is 280.
      - For 130 and 150 to remain V3 and V4 respectively when x is included, x must be placed between 130 and 150 (inclusive).
      - If x = 130, the order is 100, 120, 130, 130, 150, 180. V3=130, V4=130. Sum=260. (Incorrect)
      - If x is placed such that V3=130 and V4=150, then x must be greater than 130 but less than 150. Wait, we need V3 +
        V4 = 280.
      - 'Let''s re-examine the positions: If V3=130 and V4=150, the median is 140. This means x must be placed such that 130
        remains the 3rd value and 150 remains the 4th value.'
      - For 130 to be V3, x must be greater than or equal to 130 (x ≥ 130).
      - For 150 to be V4, x must be less than or equal to 150 (x ≤ 150).
      - Therefore, 130 ≤ x ≤ 150. A possible integer value is x = 145.

      - 'Sort the known eight values: 60, 70, 78, 80, 85, 88, 92, 95.'
      - Currently, the 4th value is 80 and the 5th value is 85.

      - For V5 + V6 = 122, we must ensure that V5 remains 60 and V6 remains 62.
      - If V5=60 and V6=62, the value x must be placed such that it does not displace the 5th value (60) or the 6th value
        (62).
      - If x is less than or equal to 60, V5 will be x or less than 60, changing the sum.
      - If x is greater than or equal to 62, the list maintains 60 as V5 and 62 as V6.
      - 'If x = 62, the order is: 50, 52, 55, 58, 60, 62, 62, 65, 70, 75. V5=60, V6=62. Sum=122. (Works)'
      - 'If x = 63, the order is: 50, 52, 55, 58, 60, 62, 63, 65, 70, 75. V5=60, V6=62. Sum=122. (Works)'
      - Thus, any integer value x ≥ 62 is a possible answer. We choose x = 63.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let the five temperatures in ascending order be A, B, C, D, E. Since N=5, the sum is Mean × 5 = 15 × 5 = 75.
      - The Median is C = 16.
      - The Mode is 18. Since C=16, the mode must occur in D and E. Thus, D=18 and E=18.
      - The sum of the remaining values (A + B) = 75 - 16 - 18 - 18 = 23.
      - The constraint is that the largest temperature (E=18) is 7 more than the smallest temperature (A). So, 18 = A + 7,
        which means A = 11.
      - Substitute A=11 into the sum of A + B = 23. B = 23 - 11 = 12.
      - 'Verify the ordered dataset: 11, 12, 16, 18, 18. Check if A <= B <= C is satisfied (11 <= 12 <= 16). All conditions
        are met.'

    - problemText: A book club tracked the number of whole novels read by its six members over the course of a month. The
        set of six readings has a Mean of 5, a Median of 5.5, and is Bimodal with modes of 5 and 6. If the Range of the dataset
        is 6, what are the six numbers of novels read?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 1, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let the six numbers be A, B, C, D, E, F. Since N=6, the sum is Mean × 6 = 5 × 6 = 30.
      - The Median is (C + D) / 2 = 5.5, so C + D = 11. Since the data are whole numbers, C=5 and D=6.
      - The data is Bimodal with modes 5 and 6. This means 5 must appear at least twice, and 6 must appear at least twice.
        Since C=5 and D=6, we must have B=5 and E=6.
      - The dataset structure is A, 5, 5, 6, 6, F. The remaining sum A + F = 30 - (5 + 5 + 6 + 6) = 8.
      - The Range is F - A = 6, so F = A + 6.
      - 'Substitute F into the sum equation: A + (A + 6) = 8. 2A + 6 = 8. 2A = 2. A = 1.'
      - 'Calculate F: F = 1 + 6 = 7. (The dataset is 1, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7).'

    - problemText: Seven students recorded their high scores on a new video game level. The scores, arranged in ascending
        order, yield a Mean of 15, a Median of 14, and a Mode of 18. The additional constraint is that the three smallest
        scores in the dataset are consecutive even numbers. Determine the seven scores.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 18, 25
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let the seven scores be A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Since N=7, the sum is Mean × 7 = 15 × 7 = 105.
      - The Median is D = 14.
      - The Mode is 18. Since D=14, 18 must appear at least twice in E, F, G. To ensure 18 is the only mode, let E=18, F=18
        (appearing twice). G must be greater than 18.
      - The sum of A + B + C + G = 105 - 14 - 18 - 18 = 55.
      - The three smallest scores (A, B, C) are consecutive even numbers. Let A = x, B = x + 2, C = x + 4.
      - 'Substitute into the sum: (x) + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + G = 55. 3x + 6 + G = 55. 3x + G = 49.'
      - Since C = x + 4 must be less than D = 14, x + 4 < 14, so x < 10. Since G > 18, G must be large.
      - 'If we try the largest possible even number for x (x=8): A=8, B=10, C=12. Sum(A, B, C) = 30.'
      - 30 + G = 55, so G = 25. Since G=25 > 18, this works.
      - The dataset is 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 18, 25.

        of 5 hours, a Median of 4.5 hours, and a Mode of 4 hours. If the largest number of hours recorded was 1 less than
        twice the smallest number of hours recorded, find the four data values.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 4, 4, 5, 7
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let the four values be A, B, C, D. The sum is Mean × 4 = 5 × 4 = 20.
      - The Median is (B + C) / 2 = 4.5, so B + C = 9.
      - The Mode is 4. Since N=4, 4 must appear twice. Since A <= B <= C, B must be 4. If B=4, then A must also be 4 (A <=
        B).
      - Substitute B=4 into B + C = 9. 4 + C = 9, so C = 5.
      - The sum of A + B + C + D = 20. 4 + 4 + 5 + D = 20. 13 + D = 20. D = 7.
      - The dataset is 4, 4, 5, 7.
      - 'Verify the constraint: Largest (D=7) is 1 less than twice the smallest (A=4). 2A - 1 = 2(4) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7. This
        matches D=7. All conditions are satisfied.'

    - problemText: Five students reported their monthly savings (in dollars). The resulting dataset has a Mean of $55, a Median
        of $50, and a Mode of $50. If the largest saving amount was exactly $10 more than the sum of the two smallest saving
        amounts, find the five monthly savings figures.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 30, 50, 50, 55, 90
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Let the five savings amounts be A, B, C, D, E. Since N=5, the total sum is Mean × 5 = 55 × 5 = 275.
      - The Median is C = 50.
      - The Mode is 50. Since C=50, 50 must appear at least twice. Since A <= B <= C, we must have B = 50.
      - The dataset structure is A, 50, 50, D, E. The remaining sum A + D + E = 275 - 50 - 50 = 175.
      - The constraint states E = (A + B) + 10. Since B=50, E = A + 50 + 10, or E = A + 60.
      - 'Substitute E into the sum A + D + E = 175: A + D + (A + 60) = 175. This simplifies to 2A + D = 115.'
      - We also require A <= 50 and D >= 50 (since D must be greater than or equal to the median 50). Also, D <= E = A + 60.
      - 'If we test A=30 (A <= 50): 2(30) + D = 115. 60 + D = 115. D = 55. (D >= 50 is satisfied).'
      - 'Calculate E: E = A + 60 = 30 + 60 = 90. (D <= E is satisfied since 55 <= 90).'
      - The dataset is 30, 50, 50, 55, 90.

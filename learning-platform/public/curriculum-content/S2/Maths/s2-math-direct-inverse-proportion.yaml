      avatarIntro: Welcome! Understanding direct proportion is key to many real-world relationships. Let's start by checking
        if the ratio between two quantities stays constant.

        toolName: scatterPlot
        parameters:
          points:
          - x: 1
            y: 20
          - x: 2
            y: 40
          - x: 3
            y: 60
          xLabel: Time (x hours)
          yLabel: Distance (y km)
          title: Distance vs. Time
      finalAnswer: Yes, y is directly proportional to x. The ratio y/x is constant (k=20).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the ratio y/x for the first pair: 20/1 = 20.'
      - 'Calculate the ratio y/x for the second pair: 40/2 = 20.'
      - 'Calculate the ratio y/x for the third pair: 60/3 = 20.'
      - Since the ratio y/x is constant (20) for all pairs, the distance is directly proportional to the time.

    - problemText: A supermarket sells organic honey. If 3 kg of honey costs $15, and 7 kg of honey costs $35, use the method
        $y_1/x_1 = y_2/x_2$ to show that the cost (y) is directly proportional to the mass (x).
      mathTool:
        toolName: none
      finalAnswer: The cost is directly proportional to the mass because 15/3 = 5 and 35/7 = 5. Since the ratios are equal,
        the relationship is proportional.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the first ratio ($y_1/x_1$): 15/3.'
      - 'Identify the second ratio ($y_2/x_2$): 35/7.'
      - 'Calculate the first ratio: 15 ÷ 3 = 5.'
      - 'Calculate the second ratio: 35 ÷ 7 = 5.'
      - Since $y_1/x_1 = y_2/x_2 = 5$, the cost is directly proportional to the mass.

    - problemText: A hose fills a large tank at a constant rate. If 4 minutes of water flow yields 40 Liters, what must happen
        to the volume of water (y) if the time (x) is tripled to 12 minutes, assuming the relationship is one of direct proportion?
      mathTool:
        toolName: none
      finalAnswer: The volume of water (y) must also triple, resulting in 120 Liters.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the property of direct proportion: if the independent variable (x) is multiplied by a factor (in this case,
        3), the dependent variable (y) must also be multiplied by the same factor.'
      - The initial time (x) is 4 minutes, and the initial volume (y) is 40 Liters.
      - 'The time is tripled: 4 * 3 = 12 minutes.'
      - 'Therefore, the volume must triple: 40 * 3 = 120 Liters.'

    - problemText: A library charges fines (y, in cents) that are directly proportional to the number of overdue days (x).
        Explain why the graph of this relationship MUST pass through the point (0, 0).
      mathTool:
        toolName: none
      finalAnswer: The graph must pass through (0, 0) because 0 days overdue (x=0) results in 0 fine cents (y=0). For any
        direct proportion relationship defined by y = kx, when x=0, y must equal 0.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define direct proportionality: y = kx, where k is a constant.'
      - 'Analyze the meaning of the coordinates: x represents overdue days, and y represents the fine.'
      - Consider the case where x = 0 (0 days overdue).
      - If x=0, then y = k * 0 = 0.
      - Since 0 days overdue results in 0 fine, the relationship must pass through the origin (0, 0).

        The total cost (y) is shown in the table:<br><br><table><thead><tr><th>Packages (x)</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total
        Cost (y $)</td><td>25</td><td>40</td><td>55</td></tr></tbody></table><br>Is the Total Cost (y) directly proportional
        to the Number of Packages (x)? Verify by checking if the ratio y/x is constant.
      mathTool:
        toolName: none
      finalAnswer: No, the Total Cost (y) is not directly proportional to the Number of Packages (x). The ratio y/x is not
        constant (25 ≠ 20 ≠ 18.33...).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Calculate the ratio y/x for the first pair: 25/1 = 25.'
      - 'Calculate the ratio y/x for the second pair: 40/2 = 20.'
      - 'Calculate the ratio y/x for the third pair: 55/3 ≈ 18.33.'
      - Since 25 ≠ 20 ≠ 18.33..., the ratio y/x is not constant. Therefore, the relationship is not directly proportional.

      finalAnswer: (a) Yes, when x = 0, y = 10(0) = 0. (b) Gradient = 10. (c) Yes, because the equation is of the form y =

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'To check if the graph passes through the origin (0, 0), substitute x = 0 into the equation: y = 10(0) = 0. Since
        (0, 0) satisfies the equation, the graph passes through the origin.'
      - For an equation in the form y = kx, the gradient is k. Here, k = 10.
      - Direct proportionality requires the relationship to be a straight line passing through the origin. Since y = 10x meets
        both criteria (y = kx form), y is directly proportional to x.

          showGrid: true
      finalAnswer: (a) Company A (C = 5n) represents direct proportion. (b) Company B's equation (C = 2n + 3) is not direct
        proportion because it has the form y = kx + c, where c = 3 (the y-intercept). Since the y-intercept is not zero, the
        graph does not pass through the origin.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Direct proportion must be represented by an equation of the form y = kx, which means the graph must pass through the
        origin (0, 0).
      - Company A's equation, C = 5n, fits the y = kx form (k=5).
      - Company B's equation, C = 2n + 3, includes a constant term c = 3. This means that even if n = 0, C = 3. The graph
        intersects the y-axis at (0, 3) and thus does not pass through the origin. Therefore, it is not direct proportion.

      finalAnswer: (a) The gradient is 2.5. (b) The gradient (k = 2.5) represents the cost per unit area, specifically, the
        cost per square meter ($2.50 per m²).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - For a direct proportion equation $y = kx$, the gradient is the constant of proportionality, $k$. In $C = 2.5n$, the
        gradient is 2.5.
      - In a contextual problem, the constant of proportionality $k = y/x$. Here, $k = C/n$.
      - Since C is cost and n is area, the gradient represents the rate of change of cost with respect to area, which is the
        cost per square meter.

        (I) $y = 0.5x$

        (a) Which equation represents $y$ being directly proportional to $x$?

        a direct proportion.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (a) Equation (I), y = 0.5x, represents direct proportion. (b) Equation (II) is not direct proportion. The
        y-intercept is 5 (since c = 5). Direct proportion requires the graph to pass through the origin (0, 0), meaning the
        y-intercept must be zero.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the form of the equations. Direct proportion requires the form y = kx, meaning there is no constant term
        (c = 0).
      - Equation (I), y = 0.5x, fits the form y = kx (k=0.5).
      - Equation (II), y = -3x + 5, is of the form y = kx + c, where c = 5.
      - Since c ≠ 0, the graph of Equation (II) crosses the y-axis at (0, 5) instead of the origin (0, 0). Therefore, it cannot
        represent direct proportionality.

      finalAnswer: As x approaches infinity, y approaches 0 (but never reaches 0). No, y can never equal zero because the

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Examine the equation: $y = 60/x$. If $x$ is a very large number (e.g., 60,000), $y$ will be very small (e.g., 0.001).'
      - As $x$ increases indefinitely, the fraction $60/x$ approaches zero.

      avatarIntro: Welcome! Understanding the definition of a quadratic equation is the first step to mastering this topic.
        Let's start with identification!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: B) $5x^2 + 2x = 0$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition: A quadratic equation must have a highest degree term of $x^2$, meaning the coefficient $a$
        cannot be zero.'
      - 'Analyze Option A: $x^3 - 4x + 1 = 0$. The highest power is 3, so this is a cubic equation.'
      - 'Analyze Option B: $5x^2 + 2x = 0$. This can be written as $5x^2 + 2x + 0 = 0$. The highest power is 2, and $a=5$
        (which is not zero). This is a quadratic equation.'
      - 'Analyze Option C: $10x - 5 = 0$. The highest power is 1, so this is a linear equation.'

    - problemText: 'Identify the values of the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ for the quadratic equation: $-2x^2 + 9 = 0$.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $a = -2, b = 0, c = 9$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Rewrite the equation in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. Since the linear term ($bx$) is missing, $b$ must
        be 0: $-2x^2 + 0x + 9 = 0$.'
      - 'Identify the coefficient of the $x^2$ term (a): $a = -2$.'
      - 'Identify the coefficient of the $x$ term (b): $b = 0$.'

    - problemText: 'State whether the following statement is True or False: The equation $x(x - 3) = x^2 + 5$ is a quadratic
        equation. Justify your answer by simplifying the equation.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: 'False'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Simplify the left side of the equation: $x(x - 3) = x^2 - 3x$.'
      - 'The equation becomes: $x^2 - 3x = x^2 + 5$.'
      - 'Move all terms to one side to achieve the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$: $x^2 - x^2 - 3x - 5 = 0$.'
      - The $x^2$ terms cancel out, resulting in $-3x - 5 = 0$.
      - Since the highest power of $x$ is 1 (the quadratic coefficient $a=0$), the equation is linear, not quadratic. Therefore,
        the statement is False.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $a = 1/2, b = -1, c = 7$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The equation is already in the standard form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
      - 'Identify the coefficient $a$ (of $x^2$): $a = 1/2$.'
      - Identify the coefficient $b$ (of $x$). Note that $-x$ is the same as $-1x$, so $b = -1$.

        of the function $y = x^2 - 36$.
      avatarIntro: Ready to tackle pure quadratic equations? Remember that taking the square root often gives you two possible
        answers!

          a: 1
          b: 0
          c: -36
      finalAnswer: $x = \pm 6$, so $x = 6$ or $x = -6$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The equation is $x^2 = 36$.
      - 'Take the square root of both sides, remembering to include both the positive and negative roots: $x = \pm\sqrt{36}$.'

        of $y = x^2 + 16$ to support your explanation.
      mathTool:

        parameters:
          a: 1
          b: 0
          c: 16
      finalAnswer: No real solution exists.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Attempt to solve the equation $x^2 = -16$ by taking the square root: $x = \pm\sqrt{-16}$.'
      - Since the square root of a negative number is undefined in the set of real numbers, there is no real solution.
      - 'Explain the reason: The square of any real number ($x^2$) must always be greater than or equal to zero. Therefore,
        $x^2$ can never equal a negative number like $-16$.'
      - The graph of $y = x^2 + 16$ confirms this, as the parabola lies entirely above the x-axis and never intercepts it.

      finalAnswer: Zero real roots. The parabola opens downward (because $a=-1$). Its vertex is at $(0, -4)$, which is below
        the x-axis. Since the parabola opens downward from a point already below the x-axis, it will never rise high enough

      finalAnswer: '12'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Step 1: Define the variables. Let the age of the younger sibling be $n$. Then the age of the older sibling is $n
        + 1$. Since ages must be positive, $n > 0$.'
      - 'Step 2: Set up the equation based on the product: $n(n + 1) = 132$.'

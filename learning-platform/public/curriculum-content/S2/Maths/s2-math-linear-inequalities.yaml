    - problemText: A driver in a residential area must maintain a speed, $s$ km/h, that is **at most** 50 km/h. Write the
        inequality for $s$. If the driver travels at 50 km/h, are they obeying the speed limit? If they travel at 50.1 km/h,
        are they obeying the limit?
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Understanding inequalities is crucial for many real-world rules, like speed limits. Let's start
        with a problem about 'at most'.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $s \le 50$. Yes, they are obeying (50 \le 50). No, they are not obeying (50.1 \le 50 is false).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the key phrase: ''at most 50 km/h''. This means 50 is the maximum allowed speed, and the speed can be equal
        to 50.'
      - 'Translate ''at most'' into the inequality symbol: $\le$ (less than or equal to).'
      - 'Write the inequality: $s \le 50$.'
      - 'Check the value $s = 50$: $50 \le 50$ is true. They are obeying the limit.'
      - 'Check the value $s = 50.1$: $50.1 \le 50$ is false. They are not obeying the limit.'

    - problemText: In Singapore, the minimum age, $a$ years, required to vote in a General Election is 21. Write the inequality
        that $a$ must satisfy. Explain why the boundary value (21) is included in the solution set.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $a \ge 21$. The boundary value 21 is included because the phrase 'minimum age' or 'at least' means that
        21 years old is the lowest acceptable age, making it a valid requirement.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the key phrase: ''minimum age is 21'' or ''at least 21''.'
      - 'Translate ''minimum'' into the inequality symbol: $\ge$ (greater than or equal to).'
      - 'Write the inequality: $a \ge 21$.'
      - 'Explain the inclusive boundary: Since it is the minimum, 21 itself is acceptable, hence the ''equal to'' part of
        the symbol.'

    - problemText: Water remains a liquid if its temperature, $T$ degrees Celsius, is **more than** 0°C but **less than**
        100°C. Write a compound inequality describing the possible values of $T$.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $0 < T < 100$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Translate ''more than 0°C'': This is a strict inequality, $T > 0$.'
      - 'Translate ''less than 100°C'': This is a strict inequality, $T < 100$.'
      - 'Combine the two strict inequalities into a single compound inequality, ensuring the variable $T$ is between the two
        bounds: $0 < T < 100$.'

    - problemText: To ride the 'Sky-High Drop' attraction, a person's height, $h$ (in meters), must be **strictly greater
        than** 1.4 meters. Write the inequality for $h$. If a person measures exactly 1.4 meters, can they ride? Which symbol
        ($>$ or $\ge$) correctly represents 'strictly greater than'?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $h > 1.4$. No, they cannot ride because 1.4 is not strictly greater than 1.4. The symbol $>$ correctly
        represents 'strictly greater than'.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the key phrase: ''strictly greater than 1.4 meters''. This excludes the boundary value.'
      - 'Translate ''strictly greater than'' into the inequality symbol: $>$ (greater than).'
      - 'Write the inequality: $h > 1.4$.'
      - 'Determine if $h=1.4$ satisfies the condition: $1.4 > 1.4$ is false, so they cannot ride.'
      - 'Identify the correct symbol: The word ''strictly'' means the boundary value is excluded, requiring the non-inclusive
        symbol $>$. '

    - problemText: A new smartphone model is expected to cost **at least** $750, but the manufacturer set a **maximum** price
        of $999. Let $C$ represent the cost of the phone. Write the compound inequality that represents the possible cost
        $C$.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: $750 \le C \le 999$
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Translate ''at least $750'' into an inequality: $C \ge 750$.'
      - 'Translate ''maximum price of $999'' into an inequality: $C \le 999$.'
      - Combine the two inclusive inequalities. Since $C$ must be greater than or equal to 750 AND less than or equal to 999,
        the compound inequality is $750 \le C \le 999$.

    - problemText: A school needs to accommodate 310 students for an overnight trip. Each dormitory room can hold a maximum
        of 24 students. Determine the minimum number of rooms ($r$) that must be booked. Form the inequality, solve for $r$,
        and interpret the solution in context.
      avatarIntro: These real-world problems require you to translate constraints like maximum and minimum into mathematical
        inequalities. Pay close attention to how you round your answers!
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The inequality is $24r \ge 310$. Solving gives $r \ge 12.916...$ Since you cannot book a partial room,
        the minimum number of rooms required is 13.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the variable: Let $r$ be the number of rooms.'
      - 'Form the inequality: Since the total capacity (24 students per room multiplied by the number of rooms, $24r$) must
        be able to hold at least 310 students, the inequality is $24r \ge 310$.'
      - 'Solve the inequality: Divide both sides by 24: $r \ge 310 / 24$, which simplifies to $r \ge 12.916...$'
      - 'Interpret the solution: Since the number of rooms must be a whole number, and $r$ must be greater than or equal to
        12.916, we must round up to the next whole number. The minimum number of rooms required is 13.'

    - problemText: A florist has a budget limit of \$150 for buying roses. A fixed delivery charge is \$12, and each rose
        bouquet ($b$) costs \$18. Calculate the maximum number of bouquets the florist can purchase without exceeding the
        budget. Form the inequality, solve for $b$, and interpret the solution in context.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The inequality is $18b + 12 \le 150$. Solving gives $b \le 7.666...$ Since the florist cannot buy a partial
        bouquet, the maximum number of bouquets they can purchase is 7.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the variable: Let $b$ be the number of bouquets.'
      - 'Form the inequality: The total cost (cost of bouquets plus fixed delivery charge) must be less than or equal to the
        budget of \$150. The inequality is $18b + 12 \le 150$.'
      - 'Solve the inequality: Subtract 12 from both sides: $18b \le 138$. Divide by 18: $b \le 138 / 18$, which simplifies
        to $b \le 7.666...$'
      - 'Interpret the solution: Since the number of bouquets must be a whole number, and $b$ must be less than or equal to
        7.666, we round down. The maximum number of bouquets the florist can purchase is 7.'

    - problemText: An electric scooter has a fully charged battery of 900 Watt-hours (Wh). It consumes energy at an average
        rate of 35 Wh per hour ($h$). The user must ensure that the remaining charge is at least 50 Wh for the safety reserve.
        Determine the maximum number of full hours ($h$) the scooter can be used before hitting the safety reserve. Form the
        inequality, solve for $h$, and interpret the solution in context.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The inequality is $900 - 35h \ge 50$. Solving gives $h \le 24.285...$ The maximum number of full hours
        the scooter can be used is 24 hours.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the variable: Let $h$ be the number of hours the scooter is used.'
      - 'Form the inequality: The initial charge (900 Wh) minus the consumed charge ($35h$) must be greater than or equal
        to the safety reserve (50 Wh). The inequality is $900 - 35h \ge 50$.'
      - 'Solve the inequality: Subtract 900 from both sides: $-35h \ge -850$. Divide by -35 and reverse the inequality sign:
        $h \le -850 / -35$, which simplifies to $h \le 24.285...$'
      - 'Interpret the solution: The question asks for the maximum number of *full* hours. Since $h$ must be less than or
        equal to 24.285, the maximum number of full hours of use is 24 hours.'

    - problemText: Sarah needs an average score of at least 90 across four exams to earn a scholarship. Her scores on the
        first three exams were 85, 93, and 88. What is the minimum integer score ($x$) she must achieve on the fourth exam
        to meet the scholarship requirement? Form the inequality, solve for $x$, and interpret the solution in context.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The inequality is $(85 + 93 + 88 + x) / 4 \ge 90$. Solving gives $x \ge 94$. The minimum integer score
        Sarah must achieve is 94 points.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the variable: Let $x$ be the score on the fourth exam.'
      - 'Form the inequality: The sum of all four scores divided by 4 must be greater than or equal to 90. The inequality
        is $(85 + 93 + 88 + x) / 4 \ge 90$.'
      - 'Simplify and solve: Calculate the sum of the known scores: $85 + 93 + 88 = 266$. The inequality is $(266 + x) / 4
        \ge 90$.'
      - 'Multiply both sides by 4: $266 + x \ge 360$.'
      - 'Subtract 266 from both sides: $x \ge 360 - 266$, so $x \ge 94$.'
      - 'Interpret the solution: Since the score must be at least 94, the minimum integer score Sarah must achieve is 94 points.'

    - problemText: To qualify for a junior training program, applicants must be strictly older than 14 years old. Liam is
        currently 13 years and 9 months old. Calculate the minimum number of full months ($m$) he must wait until he qualifies
        for the program. Form the inequality, solve for $m$, and interpret the solution in context.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Liam's current age is 165 months. The required age is 168 months. The inequality is $165 + m > 168$. Solving
        gives $m > 3$. The minimum number of full months Liam must wait is 4 months.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Convert ages to a common unit (months): Liam''s current age is $13 \times 12 + 9 = 165$ months. The minimum required
        age is $14 \times 12 = 168$ months.'
      - 'Define the variable: Let $m$ be the number of months Liam waits.'
      - 'Form the inequality: Liam''s current age plus the waiting time must be strictly greater than the minimum required
        age. $165 + m > 168$.'
      - 'Solve the inequality: Subtract 165 from both sides: $m > 3$.'
      - 'Interpret the solution: Since $m$ must be strictly greater than 3, and $m$ represents full months, the minimum integer
        value for $m$ is 4. Liam must wait a minimum of 4 full months.'

    - problemText: Plot the point P with coordinates (5, 2) on a Cartesian plane. After plotting, identify which quadrant
        P lies in.
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let us start by testing your ability to plot points using positive coordinates.
      finalAnswer: Quadrant I
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Start at the origin (0, 0).
      - Move 5 units horizontally along the positive x-axis.
      - Move 2 units vertically parallel to the positive y-axis.
      - Since both the x-coordinate (5) and the y-coordinate (2) are positive, the point lies in Quadrant I.

      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: A point A is located at coordinates (-3, -4). Describe the steps taken to move from the origin (0, 0) to
        point A, and state the quadrant in which A is located.
      finalAnswer: Move 3 units left (negative x direction) and 4 units down (negative y direction). Point A is in Quadrant
        III.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The x-coordinate is -3, meaning you move 3 units left from the origin.
      - The y-coordinate is -4, meaning you move 4 units down from the position on the x-axis.
      - When both coordinates are negative (-, -), the point lies in the third quadrant (Quadrant III).
      id: q1-2
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: 'Quadrant IV is defined by points where the x-coordinate is positive and the y-coordinate is negative.
        Which of the following coordinates lies in Quadrant IV?

        A) (-1, 5)

        B) (3, -6)

        C) (-4, -2)

        D) (0, -3)'
      finalAnswer: B) (3, -6)
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the sign pattern for Quadrant IV: (x > 0, y < 0), or (Positive, Negative).'
      - Option A is (-, +), which is Quadrant II.
      - Option B is (+, -), which matches Quadrant IV.
      - Option C is (-, -), which is Quadrant III.
      - Option D lies on the y-axis, not in a quadrant.
      id: q1-3
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: Point B is plotted at the coordinates (0, -5). Does this point lie within any of the four quadrants (I,
        II, III, or IV)? If not, state the specific location of the point.
      finalAnswer: No, the point does not lie in a quadrant. It lies on the negative y-axis.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - A point lies on an axis if one of its coordinates is zero.
      - The coordinates (0, -5) have x = 0, meaning the point is on the y-axis.
      - Since y = -5 (negative), the point is specifically located on the negative portion of the y-axis.
      id: q1-4
      questionGroup: q1
    - problemText: A point T lies in Quadrant II. State the required sign pattern for its coordinates (x, y). Then, provide
        one specific example of coordinates for point T using integers between -6 and 6.
      finalAnswer: 'Sign Pattern: (Negative x, Positive y) or (-, +). Example: (-4, 6) (Other valid examples include (-1,
        1), (-5, 3), etc.)'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Quadrant II is located to the left of the y-axis (negative x direction) and above the x-axis (positive y direction).
      - Therefore, the x-coordinate must be negative, and the y-coordinate must be positive.
      - To provide an example, select any integer x between -6 and -1, and any integer y between 1 and 6. For instance, x
        = -4 and y = 6.

      finalAnswer: Gradient = 0. This signifies that the depth is constant (there is no vertical change or slope over time/horizontal
        distance).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - The equation $y = -2$ represents a horizontal line.
      - Horizontal lines have zero slope (rise over run is 0).
      - Therefore, the gradient is 0.

        the submarine is maintaining a fixed depth.

      - The gradient formula is $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
      - For any two points on the line $x=2$, the change in x ($x_2 - x_1$) will be $2 - 2 = 0$.

        $x + y = 5$ and $2x - y = 1$. A GPS reading suggests the optimal coordinate is (1, 4). Does the point (1, 4) satisfy
        both equations simultaneously? Show your verification using substitution.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, (1, 4) is not the solution.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Substitute x = 1 and y = 4 into the first equation (Eq 1): 1 + 4 = 5. Since 5 = 5, Eq 1 is satisfied.'

        Which algebraic method—substitution or elimination—is the most efficient way to find the dimensions (x, y)? Explain
        your choice, and then solve the system using that method.'
      avatarIntro: Systems of equations can be solved using different methods. Before diving into calculations, let's practice
        choosing the quickest route!
      finalAnswer: 'Substitution is the most efficient method because the variable y is already isolated in the first equation
        (y = 2x + 1). Solution: x = 1.8, y = 4.6.'
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the most efficient method: Substitution is best because y is isolated in the first equation.'

        Which algebraic method (substitution or elimination) is the most efficient for solving this system? Explain your choice.'

        Which algebraic method would require the fewest initial manipulation steps to solve this system: substitution or elimination?
        Justify your answer.'
      finalAnswer: Substitution is the most efficient method because the variable x is already isolated in the first equation

        Determine the most efficient algebraic method to solve for x and y. If you were required to solve this system using
        a graphical method, what would be the main drawback compared to your chosen algebraic method?'
      finalAnswer: Elimination is the most efficient algebraic method because the coefficients of x already match (both are
        5). The main drawback of the graphical method is that the solution (x = 2.6, y = 2) involves a decimal, which is difficult
        to read precisely from a standard graph.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the most efficient method: Elimination is best because the coefficients of x are identical (5x), requiring
        only one subtraction step.'
      - 'Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1: $(5x + 3y) - (5x + 2y) = 19 - 17$.'

        Substitution is more efficient overall because y is already isolated in Equation 1, requiring no preliminary steps

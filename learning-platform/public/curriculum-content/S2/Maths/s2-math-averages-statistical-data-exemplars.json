        "correctAnswer": "(a) Calculate: Mean = ($2000+$2200+$2100+$2300+$2000+$2400+$15000)/7 = $28000/7 = $4000 (not $4500). Median: arranged: $2000, $2000, $2100, $2200, $2300, $2400, $15000. Position 4 → median = $2200. They might be using neither exactly, but closer to mean. (b) Median would be more honest. Most employees earn around $2000-$2400. The owner's $15000 is an outlier that inflates the mean. Job seekers should know the median ($2200) to understand what typical employees actually earn."

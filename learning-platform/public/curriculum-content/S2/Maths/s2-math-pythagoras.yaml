      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The arrangement guarantees a square corner because 60² + 80² = 3600 + 6400 = 10000. Since 100² also equals

      - 'Identify the three measurements: 9 m, 12 m, and 15 m.'
      - 'Apply the converse theorem by checking if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides equals the square of the
        longest side: 9² + 12².'
      - Calculate 81 + 144 = 225.
      - 'Calculate the square of the longest side: 15² = 225.'
      - Since 225 = 225, the boundary corner is a right angle.

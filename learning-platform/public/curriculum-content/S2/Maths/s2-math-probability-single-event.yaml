    - problemText: 'Which of the following actions is a probability experiment?

        (A) Calculating the product of 12 and 8.

        (B) Selecting a random student from a class roster to answer a question.'
      avatarIntro: Welcome! Let's start by making sure we understand the difference between experiments that rely on chance
        and those that are certain.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (B) Selecting a random student from a class roster to answer a question.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - A probability experiment is a process where the outcome depends on chance and cannot be predicted with certainty.
      - Option (A) Calculating the product of 12 and 8 always results in 96. This is a deterministic process because the outcome
        is fixed and certain.
      - Option (B) Selecting a random student means the outcome (which student is chosen) is uncertain and depends entirely
        on chance.
      - Therefore, (B) is the probability experiment.

    - problemText: Explain why spinning a spinner that is divided into four equal colored sections (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
        is considered a probability experiment.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Spinning the spinner is a probability experiment because the outcome (which color the pointer lands on)
        depends entirely on chance and cannot be predicted with certainty before the spin.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition: A probability experiment must have an outcome that is uncertain and depends on chance.'
      - When spinning a physical spinner, the force applied and the stopping point cannot be perfectly controlled or predicted.
      - Therefore, the resulting color is determined randomly, making it an outcome based on chance rather than a fixed rule.

        (i) Predicting whether it will rain tomorrow.

        (ii) Finding the exact area of a rectangle with known dimensions (length = 10 cm, width = 5 cm).'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (i) is a probability experiment. (ii) is not a probability experiment.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Evaluate (i): Predicting tomorrow''s weather involves uncertainty. Even with advanced models, the outcome (rain or
        no rain) is not certain until it happens; it depends on chance factors. Therefore, (i) is a probability experiment.'
      - 'Evaluate (ii): Finding the area of a rectangle uses a fixed formula (Area = Length × Width). Since the dimensions
        are known, the area (50 cm²) is fixed and certain. This is a deterministic process, not a probability experiment.'

    - problemText: Explain why determining if 15 is an odd or even number is not considered a probability experiment.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Determining if 15 is odd or even is not a probability experiment because the outcome is fixed and certain.
        15 is always an odd number; the result does not depend on chance or randomness.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the process: We are checking a fundamental mathematical property of the number 15.'
      - 'Analyze the outcome: 15 is an integer not divisible by 2, meaning it is definitively odd.'
      - 'Conclusion: Since the outcome is certain and fixed (deterministic) and does not rely on chance or uncertainty, it
        cannot be classified as a probability experiment.'

        (A) Drawing a single ball from a bag containing 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green balls.

        (B) Measuring the exact height of a tree that was cut down yesterday.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (A) Drawing a single ball from a bag containing 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green balls.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Analyze option (A): When drawing a ball randomly, the outcome (the color of the ball) is uncertain and depends on
        chance. This fits the definition of a probability experiment.'
      - 'Analyze option (B): Measuring the height of a fixed object (the tree) results in a specific, measurable value. While
        measurement error exists, the actual height is a fixed quantity. This is a deterministic process, not dependent on
        chance for its inherent value.'
      - Thus, only (A) is a probability experiment.

        what is the total number of possible outcomes, n(S)? Explain briefly why this number is greater than the number of
        colors available.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: n(S) = 5. The total number of outcomes is 5 because each individual bead is a distinct physical object,
        even though all green beads look alike (G₁ ≠ G₂).
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Determine the total number of individual objects in the jar: 3 green beads + 2 yellow beads = 5 objects.'
      - Recognize that in probability, identical-looking objects are treated as distinct outcomes. If G represents a green
        bead, the outcomes are G₁, G₂, G₃.
      - The total number of possible outcomes, n(S), is the count of all distinct physical objects, which is 5.
      - The number is greater than the number of colors (2) because the individual beads (e.g., G₁, G₂, G₃) are considered
        separate outcomes.

      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the number of distinct objects for each color: 4 red socks and 3 blue socks.'
      - Since each sock, regardless of color, is a distinct object (R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, B₁, B₂, B₃), the total number of outcomes
        n(S) is the total number of socks.

        these two outcomes equally likely? Explain the reason based on the definition of a fair experiment.'
      avatarIntro: 'Ready to explore the fundamentals of probability? Let''s start with one of the most classic examples:
        the coin toss!'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, the outcomes Heads and Tails are equally likely. This is because a fair coin is designed so that each
        outcome has exactly the same chance (probability) of occurring, which is 0.5 or 50%. The experiment is unbiased.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Recall the definition of equally likely outcomes: Outcomes are equally likely if they have the exact same chance
        of occurring.'
      - 'Identify the nature of the experiment: Tossing a fair coin implies there is no bias toward one side or the other.'
      - Conclude that since the coin is fair, the probability of Heads equals the probability of Tails (P(H) = P(T) = 1/2),

        why must this claim be incorrect?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The claim is incorrect because a probability value P(E) must always fall within the range 0 \u2264 P(E)
        \u2264 1. A value of 1.5 is greater than 1, which represents certainty. It is impossible for an event to have a probability
        greater than certainty.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'State the fundamental range for all probability values: 0 \u2264 P(E) \u2264 1.'
      - Identify the given probability value (1.5) and compare it to the upper limit (1).

        numerical outcomes equally likely? State the condition that must be met for these outcomes to be considered equally
        likely.
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Yes, the six individual outcomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} are equally likely. The condition required is that
        the die must be fair (unbiased), meaning that every side of the die has the same surface area, mass distribution,
        and therefore the same probability (1/6) of landing face up.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Define the experiment: Rolling a standard, fair, six-sided die.'
      - 'Identify the outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.'
      - Determine if the outcomes share the same chance. For a fair die, each outcome has P = 1/6.

    - problemText: A researcher is studying the failure rate of a machine part and calculates the probability of failure as
        P(Failure) = -0.2. Why is this value impossible based on the probability scale?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: This value is impossible because probability must be a non-negative number. The probability scale dictates
        that P(E) must be greater than or equal to 0 (0 \u2264 P(E) \u2264 1). A negative probability, like -0.2, has no physical
        or mathematical interpretation in this context.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Recall the lower boundary of the probability scale, which is 0 (representing an impossible event).
      - State the rule that probability values must be greater than or equal to 0.
      - Explain that since -0.2 is less than 0, it violates the fundamental rule of probability and is therefore an invalid
        measurement.

        your reasoning.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: No, the outcomes are not equally likely. For outcomes to be equally likely, they must all have the same
        probability. In this case, P(Red) = 0.5, P(Blue) = 0.3, and P(Green) = 0.2. Since 0.5 \u2260 0.3 \u2260 0.2, the outcomes
        have different chances of occurring, making the experiment biased.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - 'Identify the proportion (probability) associated with each outcome: P(R)=0.5, P(B)=0.3, P(G)=0.2.'
      - 'Apply the definition of equally likely outcomes: all probabilities must be identical.'
      - Compare the probabilities. Since 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2 are all different, the outcomes are not equally likely.

      finalAnswer: i) Theoretical P(6) = 1/6. ii) Experimental P(6) = 8/60 = 2/15 ≈ 0.133. iii) The probabilities differ because
        experimental probability is subject to random variation, especially in small samples (60 trials). We do not expect
        perfect alignment with the theoretical probability unless the number of trials is extremely large.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: The result from 100 tosses is expected to be closer to the theoretical probability (0.5). The Law of Large
        Numbers states that as the number of trials increases, the experimental probability tends to approach the theoretical
        probability. Small samples (like 10 tosses) are highly susceptible to random chance and variation, making their results

        theoretical probability of rolling a '3' is $1/6$ (approximately 0.167), David suspects the die is unfair because
        his experimental probability ($8/20 = 0.40$) is much higher. Evaluate David's conclusion. What recommendation would
        you give him?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: David's conclusion is premature. 20 trials is a very small sample size, and high variation is common in
        small samples due to random chance. It is normal for the experimental probability to deviate significantly from the
        theoretical probability when the sample size is small. To properly test the fairness of the die, David must conduct
        a much larger number of trials (e.g., 200 or more). If the experimental probability remains near 0.40 after hundreds
        of rolls, then he would have strong evidence to conclude the die is weighted.

      - Analyze the sample size (20 trials) and the observed deviation.
      - Explain the concept of high random variation in small samples.
      - State that a small sample size is insufficient evidence to conclude the die is unfair.

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: Group B’s result (500 spins) is likely to be more accurate. Accuracy in estimating probability improves
        as the number of trials increases. Group A's smaller sample (50 trials) is more susceptible to short-term random fluctuations,
        meaning their observed frequency might be far from 1/3. Group B’s large sample size ensures that random variations
        are averaged out over many trials, causing their experimental probability to converge closer to the theoretical probability

      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: In the short run (few trials), experimental probability is highly unstable, unpredictable, and subject
        to significant random variation, often resulting in large deviations from the theoretical probability. In the long
        run (many trials), the experimental probability becomes much more stable and predictable. The Law of Large Numbers
        dictates that as the number of trials increases, the calculated experimental probability will converge, or get arbitrarily
        close, to the theoretical probability. The long run is superior because increased trials average out the noise and
        randomness inherent in small samples, providing a robust and reliable estimate.

      id: q13-4
      questionGroup: q13
    - problemText: The Law of Large Numbers states that experimental probability approaches theoretical probability as the
        number of trials increases. If a student performs 10,000 coin tosses, why is it still highly unlikely that the experimental
        probability of Heads will be *exactly* 0.5 (i.e., exactly 5,000 heads)?
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: While the Law of Large Numbers guarantees that the experimental probability will get extremely close to
        the theoretical probability (0.5) as the number of trials increases (10,000 is a large sample), it does not guarantee
        exact equality. Probability experiments are inherently random. Even a tiny amount of remaining random variation or
        chance fluctuation means that the number of heads might be 4,998 or 5,001, resulting in a probability slightly above
        or below 0.5. 'Approaching' the theoretical value means getting arbitrarily close, but achieving the exact theoretical
        ratio is possible but extremely improbable.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Acknowledge that 10,000 trials is a large sample, ensuring the result is close to 0.5.
      - Distinguish between 'approaching' and 'equaling' the theoretical probability.
      - Explain that true randomness ensures that slight chance variations will almost always prevent the outcome from hitting
        the exact theoretical ratio (5000/10000).
      - Conclude that while the expected outcome is 5000, the high number of possible outcomes means achieving the precise
        count is statistically unlikely.

        (i) What is the probability of winning a Golden Ticket?

        (ii) If a student buys a box only if the chance of winning a Silver or Golden Ticket combined is greater than 50%,
        should they buy a box? Justify your answer using probability.'
      mathTool: null
      finalAnswer: (i) 1/8; (ii) No, because the probability is exactly 50% (1/2), not greater than 50%.
      stepByStepGuideline:
      - Identify the total number of outcomes (boxes), which is 40.
      - 'For part (i), the number of Golden Tickets is 5. Calculate the probability: P(Golden Ticket) = 5/40 = 1/8.'
      - 'For part (ii), calculate the total number of favorable outcomes (Golden or Silver): 5 + 15 = 20.'
      - 'Calculate the combined probability: P(Golden or Silver) = 20/40 = 1/2, or 50%.'
      - Since the condition requires the probability to be *greater* than 50%, and 50% is not greater than 50%, the student
        should not buy the box.
